Remote sensing in agriculture requires complex systems that are able to communicate with various external devices like GPS and cameras, and use machine learning and AI inference to provide insights to the grower regarding their orchard, down to tree and crop-level precision. Aurea Imaging, a Dutch startup company, specializes in remote sensing solutions for agriculture using an embedded device with a powerful GPU-enabled NVIDIA Jetson on board. Instead of opting for the traditional embedded C &a...

🏷️ cloud, security, automation, deployment, infrastructure

In 2026, as companies increasingly look to infuse AI across their operations, a strong, secure, and automated hybrid cloud foundation will become a key competitive advantage. Cloud complexity is a widespread problem. But transformative companies are taking back control. From streamlining provisioning to tracking real-time spend and building consistent security practices across hybrid landscapes, those that prioritize AI-driven automation will be able to accelerate innovation and optimize their e...

### [Your AI Workflow Is Missing a Composable Architecture](https://thenewstack.io/your-ai-workflow-is-missing-a-composable-architecture/)

🏷️ cloud

&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t ask the model to build your whole app. Break your request into smaller parts and generate one function, hook, or component at a time.&rdquo; You&rsquo;ve probably heard this advice if you use AI tools like Copilot or ChatGPT to write code. It&rsquo;s solid advice because smaller prompts tend to produce cleaner output and fewer hallucinations. They also give you more control over what lands in your codebase. However, even when your prompts are super-descriptive, and the snippet...

🏷️ cloud, security, reliability, devops, monitoring

Every engineer has a moment early in their career when they realize the truth: You cannot learn everything. Much like doctors choose specialties, engineers eventually pick lanes. Backend, infrastructure, DevOps, mobile, frontend, machine learning systems. Not because we lack curiosity, but because there is simply too much to know. Technology evolves, interests shift, tools advance and our skills follow. Yet beneath all the specialization, there is a shared foundation. We all learned how variable...

### [Why Decoupling Control and Data Planes Is the Future of SaaS](https://thenewstack.io/why-decoupling-control-and-data-planes-is-the-future-of-saas/)

🏷️ cloud, security, aws, monitoring, automation

Over the last decade, the industry accepted a simple truth: If you wanted a Software as a Service (SaaS) product, you consumed it in the cloud that the vendor selected. Convenience won over flexibility. Vendors built on their preferred hyperscaler, customers followed and that single operational model shaped the boundaries of what was possible. That era is fading. A different pattern is rising, driven by architectural principles creating freedom, not friction. The separation of the control plane ...

DevOps practices are the core of contemporary organizational activities. Integrating artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) into DevOps practices can transform an organization&#8217;s mode of operations. Companies have increased efficiency in developing, testing and deploying software with this integration. Automating repetitive tasks eliminates the need for human supervision while enhancing reliability, scalability and efficiency. [&#8230;]

Everything in tech is always changing at what feels like a breakneck pace &mdash; everything except DevOps infrastructure, that is. Actually, George Fahmy, co-founder and CEO at Stakpak, says managing infrastructure is getting harder &mdash; that&rsquo;s in spite of the AI wave. Or perhaps because of it? &ldquo;Since LLMs [large language models] came out&hellip; we realized that they&rsquo;re really good at coding&mdash;and most developers actually enjoy coding,&rdquo; he remarks. &ldquo;But the...

As AI increasingly permeates the software development landscape, new research from OpenAI offers sobering insights into the current limitations of even the most advanced AI coding assistants. The benchmark study, &#8220;SWE-Lancer: Can Frontier LLMs Earn $1 Million from Real-World Freelance Software Engineering?&#8221; presents evidence that despite rapid advances, today&#8217;s frontier AI models still fall short [&#8230;]

### [Kubernetes v1.35: Introducing Workload Aware Scheduling](https://kubernetes.io/blog/2025/12/29/kubernetes-v1-35-introducing-workload-aware-scheduling/)

**Source:** Kubernetes Blog | **Date:** 2025-12-29 18:30 | **Reading Time:** ~6 min

🏷️ kubernetes

Scheduling large workloads is a much more complex and fragile operation than scheduling a single Pod, as it often requires considering all Pods together instead of scheduling each one independently. For example, when scheduling a machine learning batch job, you often need to place each worker strategically, such as on the same rack, to make the entire process as efficient as possible. At the same time, the Pods that are part of such a workload are very often identical from the scheduling perspec...
