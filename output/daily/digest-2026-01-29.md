### [The top 5 sources of secret sprawl, and how attackers exploit them](https://www.hashicorp.com/blog/the-top-5-sources-of-secret-sprawl-and-how-attackers-exploit-them)

**Source:** HashiCorp Blog | **Author:** Chandni Patel | **Date:** 2026-01-28 17:00 | **Reading Time:** ~6 min

🏷️ gitlab, ci/cd, security, infrastructure, docker

Exposed secrets account for nearly 30% of all data breaches, with the average incident costing organizations $4.45 million. Despite heightened awareness, secret sprawl remains one of the most persistent and underestimated security risks. API keys, tokens, and credentials govern how systems trust one another. When exposed, they allow attackers to operate with the permissions needed to quietly move across environments, clouds, and production systems. What starts as a single leak often becomes a ch...

### [Mastra empowers web devs to build AI agents in TypeScript](https://thenewstack.io/mastra-empowers-web-devs-to-build-ai-agents-in-typescript/)

**Source:** The New Stack | **Author:** Loraine Lawson | **Date:** 2026-01-28 19:00 | **Reading Time:** ~5 min

🏷️ deployment, observability, github, cloud

Python dominated the early days of machine learning, but that&rsquo;s changing as AI becomes more mainstream. Take, for instance, the recent release of Mastra, an open source agentic AI framework that uses TypeScript rather than Python. Developers are less interested in what goes into a large language model and more intrigued by how to build an application on top of these models, according to Sam Bhagwat, Mastra&rsquo;s co-creator and a full stack developer best known for his work as co-founder ...

### [Kubernetes telemetry feature fully compromises clusters](https://thenewstack.io/kubernetes-telemetry-feature-fully-compromises-clusters/)

🏷️ helm, kubernetes, security, monitoring, pipeline

If Kubernetes admins don&rsquo;t have enough to worry about with the upcoming Nginx gateway cutoff, they now may need to rifle through their Helm charts to potentially thwart a dangerous setting. Security researcher Graham Helton has shared a Kubernetes vulnerability he unearthed that allows some random user, armed with read-only permission, to run arbitrary and even privileged commands on any pod in a cluster. His trick is to use a service account with permissions for the Kubernetes nodes/proxy...

### [With Auto Browse, Google Chrome can now surf the web for you](https://thenewstack.io/with-auto-browse-google-chrome-can-now-surf-the-web-for-you/)

For a while now, Google has been on a mission to extend its Chrome browser with more AI features, powered by its Gemini models. Now, the company is launching a slew of new AI features based on Gemini 3 that include a new Auto Browse feature, a new AI side panel for interacting with Gemini and an integration with its Nano Banana imaging model. It is also bringing built-in Gemini support to Chromebooks. Let Chrome browse for you The flagship feature of this launch is Auto Browse. This isn&rsquo;t ...

**Source:** The New Stack | **Author:** Dmitry Shurupov | **Date:** 2026-01-28 17:00 | **Reading Time:** ~5 min

🏷️ gitlab, kubernetes, ci/cd, helm, infrastructure

Various cloud native projects are celebrating their first decade. While there are obvious big names, such as Kubernetes itself, Helm, and Cilium, the ecosystem is much wider and includes lesser-known tools that have been around for a while as well. I&rsquo;ve been involved in the werf project since its inception more than 10 years ago, and I&rsquo;d like to share its story to contribute to a broader picture of the present cloud native world. What is werf? Basically, it&rsquo;s an opinionated, al...

**Source:** DevOps.com | **Author:** Joseph M. Saunders | **Date:** 2026-01-28 16:39 | **Reading Time:** ~1 min

🏷️ security

Software supply chain security is steadily moving to the forefront of cybersecurity conversations. In the past, it has been overshadowed by a focus on malware outbreaks, ransomware, endpoint protection, and application vulnerabilities. That changed this month, when OWASP elevated software supply chain failures to third place on its 2025 Top 10 list. The OWASP Top [&#8230;]

**Source:** The New Stack | **Author:** Richard MacManus | **Date:** 2026-01-28 16:00 | **Reading Time:** ~6 min

🏷️ cloud

It&rsquo;s rare that a web product lasts 25 years, given how fast the industry cycles through technologies. But this month marks a quarter century of Drupal, the open source content management system (CMS). To mark the occasion, and also to discuss the launch of Drupal CMS 2.0 &mdash; which, confusingly, is not version 2 of the original Drupal &mdash; we spoke to founder Dries Buytaert. &ldquo;I think people think Drupal is this overnight success or something,&rdquo; Buytaert tells The New Stack...

🏷️ kubernetes, cloud, pipeline

Agoda is the Singapore wing of Booking Holdings, the world&rsquo;s leading provider of online travel (the brand behind Booking.com, Kayak, Priceline, etc.). From January 2023 to February 2025, Agoda server traffic spiked by 50 times. That&rsquo;s fantastic business growth, but also the trigger for an interesting engineering challenge. Specifically, the team had to determine how to scale their ScyllaDB-backed online feature store to maintain 10ms P99 latencies despite this growth. Complicating th...
