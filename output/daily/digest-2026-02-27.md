🏷️ kubernetes, infrastructure

The Kubernetes Working Group (WG) Serving was created to support development of the AI inference stack on Kubernetes. The goal of this working group was to ensure that Kubernetes is an orchestration platform of choice for inference workloads. This goal has been accomplished, and the working group is now being disbanded. WG Serving formed workstreams to collect requirements from various model servers, hardware providers, and inference vendors. This work resulted in a common understanding of infer...

🏷️ deployment, github, kubernetes, cloud, helm

The Gateway API isn&#8217;t just an &#8220;Ingress v2&#8221;, it&#8217;s an entirely revamped approach for exposing services from within Kubernetes and eliminates the need of encoding routing capabilities into vendor-specific, unstructured annotations. In this post, we will explore how to expose WebAssembly applications built using the CNCF Spin framework and served by SpinKube using the Gateway API. What is SpinKube SpinKube, a CNCF sandbox project, is an open-source stack for running serverles...

### [Docker Model Runner Brings vLLM to macOS with Apple Silicon](https://www.docker.com/blog/docker-model-runner-vllm-metal-macos/)

**Source:** Docker Blog | **Author:** Yiwen Xu | **Date:** 2026-02-26 14:42 | **Reading Time:** ~6 min

🏷️ github, docker

vLLM has quickly become the go-to inference engine for developers who need high-throughput LLM serving. We brought vLLM to Docker Model Runner for NVIDIA GPUs on Linux, then extended it to Windows via WSL2. That changes today. Docker Model Runner now supports vllm-metal, a new backend that brings vLLM inference to macOS using Apple Silicon&#8217;s Metal GPU. If you have a Mac with an M-series chip, you can now run MLX models through vLLM with the same OpenAI-compatible API, same Anthropic-compat...

🏷️ infrastructure, observability, cloud, security

Andrej Karpathy probably didn&rsquo;t set out to retire &ldquo;vibe coding&rdquo; just a year after popularizing it, but time and technological advancement forced his hand. The developer community is at a crossroads &mdash; clinging to a label while navigating a landscape that has evolved beyond it. Karpathy recently suggested &ldquo;agentic engineering&rdquo; as a more accurate description of where AI-assisted development has landed. A collection of tech industry voices responds here to Karpath...

🏷️ cloud, azure, gcp, infrastructure, devops

Every once in a while, I come across a tool that makes me lean back and go, &ldquo;Wooo, that&rsquo;s cool!&rdquo; Well, I recently had that very thing happen after installing a monitor called Netdata. According to its site, Netdata is a &ldquo;Zero-config observability with an on-call AI partner. Per-second metrics that stay on-prem; Netdata AI investigates, explains root cause, and guides fixes in plain English.&rdquo; I had no idea what was in store for me upon completing the installation, bu...

🏷️ sre, cloud, pipeline, prometheus, infrastructure

Observability platform migrations are rarely simple. You&rsquo;re still balancing risk (don&rsquo;t break on-call), scope (don&rsquo;t try to move everything at once), and organizational change (getting teams to validate and adopt new workflows). The goal of this post is to share the common patterns that make it manageable when you&rsquo;re ready to undertake it using open standards instrumentation. We&rsquo;ll focus on migrations where metrics, traces, and logs already flow through open-source ...

### [Why the secret to scaling AI isn’t a better model, it’s a simpler foundation](https://thenewstack.io/ai-unified-data-foundation/)

**Source:** The New Stack | **Author:** Ajay Khanna | **Date:** 2026-02-26 13:00 | **Reading Time:** ~6 min

🏷️ sre, deployment, cloud, pipeline, infrastructure

A recent study from MIT&rsquo;s NANDA initiative highlights a persistent challenge in enterprise AI adoption. Despite heavy investment and experimentation, roughly 95% of corporate AI efforts fail to deliver clear, measurable value. Models and agents dominate the current AI conversation, but the true success or failure of real-world AI applications hinges on their underlying data architecture. Developers can spin up agents, run experiments, and build intelligent workflows in hours using framewor...

🏷️ deployment, argocd, cloud, prometheus, infrastructure

We are at an inflection point in enterprise IT. For the last decade, &ldquo;modernization&rdquo; has been synonymous with containerization &mdash; essentially packaging applications so they can run anywhere. But the goalposts have moved. The challenge is no longer just about running static microservices; it is about preparing for an era of Agentic AI and dynamic, resource-hungry workloads that defy traditional infrastructure planning. This isn&rsquo;t just a technical pivot; it&rsquo;s a surviva...
