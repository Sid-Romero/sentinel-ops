🏷️ sre, kubernetes, cloud, security, infrastructure

Agentic systems are rapidly moving from experimentation into real production workloads. Cloud native teams are now being asked to connect models to real tools, data, and workflows in reliable, secure ways—without relying on brittle, one-off integrations. As MCP emerges as a shared, interoperable layer under vendor-neutral stewardship, Agentics Day provides a focused space for the community to exchange real-world implementations and shape best practices while the ecosystem is still evolving.

### [Red Hat takes on Docker Desktop with its enterprise Podman Desktop build](https://thenewstack.io/red-hat-enters-the-cloud-native-developer-desktop-market/)

**Source:** The New Stack | **Author:** Steven J. Vaughan-Nichols | **Date:** 2026-02-20 21:00 | **Reading Time:** ~4 min

🏷️ pipeline, kubernetes, cloud, security, docker

Red Hat is perhaps the biggest name in enterprise Linux, but it&rsquo;s also a major cloud-native player thanks to its Kubernetes distribution, OpenShift. What it hasn&rsquo;t had, though, is a supported, enterprise build of its own open source, container-oriented desktop app&hellip; until now. The recent release of the Red Hat build of Podman Desktop is the company&rsquo;s bet that a tight integration with OpenShift and Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) will make Podman Desktop&rsquo;s container-...

### [Survey: Adoption of AI Software Testing Slowed by Trust Issues](https://devops.com/survey-adoption-of-ai-software-testing-slowed-by-trust-issues/)

**Source:** DevOps.com | **Author:** James Maguire | **Date:** 2026-02-20 19:58 | **Reading Time:** ~1 min

A new global survey from Leapwork underscores a growing tension in software development: while AI is widely viewed as essential to the future of testing, many teams remain hesitant to rely on it for mission-critical workflows. Based on responses from more than 300 engineers and IT decision-makers, the research indicates that enthusiasm for AI-enabled testing is high. [&#8230;]

### [NanoClaw’s answer to OpenClaw is minimal code, maximum isolation](https://thenewstack.io/nanoclaw-minimalist-ai-agents/)

**Source:** The New Stack | **Author:** Frederic Lardinois | **Date:** 2026-02-20 19:00 | **Reading Time:** ~6 min

🏷️ pipeline, security, infrastructure, docker, github

Gavriel Cohen built NanoClaw,&nbsp;a lightweight alternative to OpenClaw, in a weekend after learning about&nbsp;security flaws in the popular agentic framework. On this edition of The New Stack Agents, we talk to Cohen about how he is building NanoClaw, how he is using it, and what he learned about the future of programming from the experience. Cohen is the co-founder of AI marketing agency Qwibit, where he was already running agents for everything &mdash; operations, research, sales pipeline, ...

### [96% of developers don’t trust AI code: Here’s a step toward the fix](https://thenewstack.io/agentic-ai-verification-impact/)

**Source:** The New Stack | **Author:** Manish Kapur | **Date:** 2026-02-20 18:05 | **Reading Time:** ~4 min

🏷️ reliability, security, infrastructure, microservices, deployment

The narrative surrounding software development has shifted dramatically over the last six months. The industry has moved past the initial awe of Large Language Models (LLMs) and entered the era of agentic AI development &mdash; where autonomous systems aren&rsquo;t just suggesting lines of code, but are actively refactoring services and managing multi-step deployments across the repository. However, while development teams have made leaps in velocity, a friction point has emerged: the gap betwee...

### [The reason big tech is giving away AI agent frameworks](https://thenewstack.io/agent-framework-container-wars/)

**Source:** The New Stack | **Author:** Janakiram MSV | **Date:** 2026-02-20 17:29 | **Reading Time:** ~8 min

🏷️ observability, pipeline, kubernetes, cloud, security

As someone who had a front-row seat to the container orchestration wars, I am watching the same movie play out again with AI agent frameworks. It&rsquo;s just that the cast is different, and the stakes are much higher, but the plot is almost identical. In 2015, if you wanted to orchestrate containers, you had a plethora of choices. Docker Swarm, Apache Mesos, Hashicorp Nomad, and, of course, Kubernetes in its early form. Each had genuine technical merit. Smart people argued passionately for thei...

🏷️ security, infrastructure, cloud

What will drive the next wave of innovation in enterprise applications? Ask the experts, and you&rsquo;ll likely hear a similar answer: data platforms that enable AI to operate effectively at scale. With AI transforming industries across the board, the infrastructure that powers it plays a critical role. Yet many businesses are finding it increasingly complex to manage their data architecture, integrate AI capabilities, and meet performance and scalability expectations. Modern operational data p...

In traditional software, requirements are static design-time artifacts. In AI-enabled systems, they must be continuously observed and enforced in production. Learn how AI collapses the boundary between design-time and runtime, shifting requirements toward behavioral constraints, continuous verification, and shared ownership across engineering and operations
