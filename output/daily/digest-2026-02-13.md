### [Securing modern workloads with HashiCorp Vault and WIF](https://www.hashicorp.com/blog/securing-modern-workloads-with-hashicorp-vault-and-wif)

**Source:** HashiCorp Blog | **Author:** Nesh Chandarana | **Date:** 2026-02-12 17:00 | **Reading Time:** ~4 min

🏷️ deployment, devops, infrastructure, gcp, gitlab

Modern enterprises are increasingly cloud-native, running workloads across multiple clouds, Kubernetes clusters, and CI/CD pipelines. For CIOs, CISOs, and technical managers, the challenge is clear: traditional static credentials and perimeter-based security are no longer enough. HashiCorp Vault, combined with workload identity federation (WIF), allows organizations to enforce zero trust principles while reducing risk, improving auditability, and streamlining operations. The risk of static crede...

### [The reason AI agents shouldn’t touch your source code — and what they should do instead](https://thenewstack.io/dynatrace-ai-safety-mechanism/)

**Source:** The New Stack | **Author:** Nick Lucchesi | **Date:** 2026-02-13 00:11 | **Reading Time:** ~2 min

🏷️ observability, security

Dynatrace is experiencing a major moment in its history. It&rsquo;s expanding from an observability platform what might be described as a new environment, one that offers configurations for autonomous operations and security. In this episode of The New Stack Makers, Alois Reitbauer, Chief Technology Strategist at Dynatrace, unpacks his predictions for a world where agentic AI manages production environments. This interview, recorded at the Dynatrace Perform conference in late January, took place...

🏷️ github

The latest iteration of the TIOBE Index of programming languages indicates that more specialized languages are creeping up on Python&rsquo;s dominance. Although Python remains the most popular programming language, the index suggests that several more specialized languages are gradually gaining ground at Python&rsquo;s expense, most notably R and Perl. Python has maintained a lead of more than 10 percentage points over its closest competitors. In absolute terms, Python reached its peak popularit...

### [Bridging the Dev–Security Gap With Smarter Authorization](https://devops.com/bridging-the-dev-security-gap-with-smarter-authorization/)

**Source:** DevOps.com | **Author:** Nick Kucharski | **Date:** 2026-02-12 22:29 | **Reading Time:** ~1 min

🏷️ security

Software teams have always lived with a built-in tension – developers push to ship fast, while security teams pump the brakes to assess risk. Now, with AI flooding the enterprise, that friction is spiking. One recent survey found a staggering 322% jump in privilege-escalation risks tied to AI-generated code. The root problem isn’t new – [&#8230;]

### [Your RAG System is probably image-blind, but it doesn’t have to be](https://thenewstack.io/multimodal-rag-hybrid-search/)

**Source:** The New Stack | **Author:** Tushar Madaan | **Date:** 2026-02-12 20:00 | **Reading Time:** ~6 min

🏷️ deployment, cloud, pipeline, kubernetes

In the race to deploy generative AI, most enterprises have mastered &ldquo;text RAG&rdquo; to chat with PDFs and spreadsheets. However, enterprise data is rarely just text. It is a complex tapestry of technical manuals with diagrams, insurance claims with damage photos, medical records with X-rays, and product catalogs with high-resolution imagery. To unlock the true value of these assets, businesses must move beyond text-only RAG. The next frontier is multimodal RAG with hybrid search. The busi...

### [VS Code becomes multi-agent command center for developers](https://thenewstack.io/vs-code-becomes-multi-agent-command-center-for-developers/)

**Source:** The New Stack | **Author:** Darryl K. Taft | **Date:** 2026-02-12 18:38 | **Reading Time:** ~4 min

🏷️ security, github, cloud

With its Visual Studio Code (VS Code) January 2026 release (v1.109), Microsoft is making the code editor &ldquo;the home for multi-agent development,&rdquo; introducing support for Anthropic Claude and&nbsp;OpenAI Codex agents, as well as an updated session management system that lets developers orchestrate multiple AI assistants from a single interface. This shifts developers from a single-agent workflow to a multi-agent paradigm, allowing them to run GitHub Copilot, Claude, and Codex side by s...

### [OpenAI’s new Codex Spark model is built for speed](https://thenewstack.io/openais-new-codex-spark-is-optimized-for-speed/)

**Source:** The New Stack | **Author:** Frederic Lardinois | **Date:** 2026-02-12 18:00 | **Reading Time:** ~4 min

🏷️ pipeline

OpenAI&rsquo;s new GPT-5.3-Codex-Spark model is a bit of a departure for the company&rsquo;s family of Codex software development models: its focus is squarely on reducing latency. Powered by Cerebras&rsquo; 125-petaflop Wafer Scale Engine 3, the Codex Spark model is meant for use cases where latency matters as much &mdash; or more &mdash; than intelligence. And fast it is: Codex Spark can deliver more than 1,000 tokens per second. When OpenAI launched GPT-5.3-Codex only a few days ago, it highl...

### [How intelligent orchestration transforms software innovation](https://thenewstack.io/ai-paradox-gitlab/)

**Source:** The New Stack | **Author:** Manav Khurana | **Date:** 2026-02-12 16:00 | **Reading Time:** ~6 min

🏷️ observability, deployment, jenkins, gitlab, pipeline

The software industry reached an inflection point in November and December 2025. Three breakthrough AI model releases, Gemini 3 by Google, Opus 4.5 by Anthropic, and GPT-5.2 by OpenAI, delivered capabilities that forced industry leaders to reevaluate AI&rsquo;s role in software development. Gergely Orosz reports in his Pragmatic Engineer newsletter that experienced engineers now trust AI to generate 90% or more of their production code. But here&rsquo;s the challenge: innovation speed depends on...

### [The hidden reason database debt is ten times harder to fix than code](https://thenewstack.io/managing-database-debt/)

**Source:** The New Stack | **Author:** Wen Jie Teo | **Date:** 2026-02-12 15:00 | **Reading Time:** ~6 min

🏷️ pipeline, monitoring

Technical debt is an inevitable byproduct of software development as complexity grows. However, unlike stateless application code, the stateful nature of databases makes this debt far easier to accumulate and significantly harder to pay off, sometimes taking weeks and even months of planning and execution. Existing data creates massive inertia against change, and having different sets of data in different environments, from development to production, makes problems hard to predict. Add in the pa...

### [Arcjet SDKs Make It Simpler for Developers to Include Security Functions](https://devops.com/arcjet-sdks-make-it-simpler-for-developers-to-include-security-functions/)

**Source:** DevOps.com | **Author:** Mike Vizard | **Date:** 2026-02-12 14:48 | **Reading Time:** ~1 min

🏷️ security

Arcjet this week made available a software development kit (SDK) that makes it simpler for JavaScript developers to embed capabilities such as bot detection, rate limiting, email validation, attack protection and data redaction directly within their applications. Company CEO David Mytton said the release of v1.0 of its Arcjet JavaScript SDK makes it possible for [&#8230;]

### [ShareChat hit a billion features per second, then it had to make it 10x cheaper](https://thenewstack.io/scylladb-database-sharechat/)

**Source:** The New Stack | **Author:** Cynthia Dunlop | **Date:** 2026-02-12 14:00 | **Reading Time:** ~10 min

🏷️ deployment, infrastructure, gcp, azure, cloud

&ldquo;Great system&hellip;now please make it 10 times cheaper.&rdquo; That&rsquo;s not exactly what the ShareChat team wanted to hear after completing a major engineering feat: scaling a real-time feature store 1000X without scaling their database (ScyllaDB). To scale from supporting 1 million features per second to 1 billion features per second, the team has already. Redesigned their database schema to store all features together as protocol buffers and optimized tile configurations (reduced r...

**Source:** DevOps.com | **Author:** Vikram Srivats | **Date:** 2026-02-12 11:32 | **Reading Time:** ~1 min

The enterprise technology landscape is on the verge of a major transformation, driven by two key trends: open telecom network APIs and AI-powered coding platforms. This convergence allows businesses to create intelligent, network-aware applications rapidly, empowering them to leverage connectivity in innovative ways. As telcos position their networks as programmable platforms, and AI simplifies software development, organizations can expect a significant acceleration in application creation, lea...
