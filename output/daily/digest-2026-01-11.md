Enterprises experimenting with large language models (LLMs) often encounter the same challenges once pilot projects move into production. Infrastructure costs escalate rapidly, response times become unpredictable under load and outputs are difficult to audit or explain. While LLMs remain useful for exploration and prototyping, their size and generality make them difficult to operate sustainably within enterprise platforms. A practical alternative emerging in production systems is the combination...

### [Beyond Python: Why LLMs Need More Stable, Open Source Code](https://thenewstack.io/beyond-python-why-llms-need-more-stable-open-source-code/)

In the future dreams of Large Language Models, there will be no need for human intervention and they will write code in a highly efficient form unreadable to us. Perhaps they will write directly in binary. But for now, we need our LLM assistants to write readable code, in an established programming language. So what languages do LLMs prefer to use today? In terms of the programming language most popular with human developers, where we assume models get their training material from, the choices s...

You&rsquo;ve may have heard that Arch Linux isn&rsquo;t exactly the easiest Linux distribution to install or use. What if I told you that there&rsquo;s a distribution based on Arch Linux that makes it easy enough for just about anyone to use? Well, that&rsquo;s a reality, and the distribution in question is Manjaro. Manjaro came into being in 2011 and didn&rsquo;t hit the beta stage until two years later. The big selling point of this take on Arch Linux is its ease of installation. Where Arch Li...

&ldquo;AI for the Enterprise: The Playbook for Developing and Scaling Your AI Strategy&rdquo; is a new ebook I wrote for The New Stack with sponsorship from Red Hat and Intel. It walks organizational leaders through how to establish and communicate a cross-organizational AI strategy, and then how to enact and measure it all. The book balances experimenting with AI for the biggest wins and getting the proven &mdash; and yes, often boring &mdash; AI use cases in place. It helps engineering teams s...

The API platform Postman announced Thursday it has acquired Fern, a developer experience company that helps developers ship API documentation and build software development kits (SDKs). &ldquo;Great APIs are defined by great developer experiences,&rdquo; said Abhinav Asthana, CEO and co-founder of Postman, in the acquisition announcement. &ldquo;Fern shares our belief that documentation and SDKs are critical to API adoption. By bringing Fern into the Postman family, we&rsquo;re helping more team...
