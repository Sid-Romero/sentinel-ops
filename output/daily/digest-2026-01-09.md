### [Honeycomb’s ‘Private Cloud’ Is Largely About OpenTelemetry, AI and AWS](https://thenewstack.io/honeycombs-private-cloud-is-largely-about-opentelemetry-ai-and-aws/)

**Source:** The New Stack | **Author:** B. Cameron Gain | **Date:** 2026-01-08 21:00 | **Reading Time:** ~4 min

🏷️ infrastructure, automation, observability, aws, azure

The observability provider Honeycomb has named its recent offering for private cloud &mdash; eponymously called Private Cloud. It is largely designed to accommodate the explosion of code and AI hallucinations, for which observability is increasingly required. Additionally, it is almost exclusively for AWS. That excludes, at this time, the other major hyperscalers as well as on-premises environments. OpenTelemetry also plays a major role, particularly in standardization, especially for metrics. &...

### [A New JavaScript Framework? In this Economy?](https://thenewstack.io/a-new-javascript-framework-in-this-economy/)

**Source:** The New Stack | **Author:** Loraine Lawson | **Date:** 2026-01-08 20:00 | **Reading Time:** ~4 min

After 20 years in software, full-stack developer Yaniv Soussana is tired of complexity in React-based JavaScript frameworks. So the creator of the app conversion tool Wappaa did what developers tend to do: He built a new framework, called Sigment. &ldquo;I wanted to create something better than React and Angular, because I&rsquo;m already tired of all this &mdash; I wanted to create something simple for developers,&rdquo; he said. Sigment simplifies by exemption, which means it does not: Combine...

### [Unify the Data Stack for AI With Incremental Cloud Migrations](https://thenewstack.io/unify-the-data-stack-for-ai-with-incremental-cloud-migrations/)

**Source:** The New Stack | **Author:** Joseph Morais | **Date:** 2026-01-08 19:00 | **Reading Time:** ~5 min

🏷️ microservices, cloud

Even as AI offloads repetitive tasks and accelerates learning and productivity, you hear more anecdotes every day about AI systems that weren&rsquo;t quite ready for production. Examples of AI-powered errors in financial services, health care and the legal system reveal what&rsquo;s at risk when these systems are built on a fragmented data foundation. Although we can&rsquo;t count on AI to always get it right just yet, it&rsquo;s not necessarily because the underlying models aren&rsquo;t ready. ...

### [Why Most APIs Fail in AI Systems and How To Fix It](https://thenewstack.io/why-most-apis-fail-in-ai-systems-and-how-to-fix-it/)

**Source:** The New Stack | **Author:** Frank Kilcommins | **Date:** 2026-01-08 18:00 | **Reading Time:** ~8 min

🏷️ automation, pipeline, security, aws

Over the past few years, I&rsquo;ve reviewed thousands of APIs across startups, enterprises and global platforms. Almost all shipped OpenAPI documents. On paper, they should be well-defined and interoperable. In practice, most fail when consumed predictably by AI systems. They were designed for human readers, not machines that need to reason, plan and safely execute actions. When APIs are ambiguous, inconsistent or structurally unreliable, AI systems struggle or fail outright. The result is a gr...

### [3 Ways Enterprises Can Scale AI Gains in 2026](https://thenewstack.io/3-ways-enterprises-can-scale-ai-gains-in-2026/)

🏷️ security, cloud, deployment

Most organizations are ending 2025 with tangible AI wins. Developers are shipping code faster, costs are down and leadership is thrilled that everyone is embracing AI. Congratulations. You&rsquo;re about to face a whole new set of problems. The decisions you make about scaling, governance and strategic integration in 2026 will make a crucial difference to how your organization performs in the coming years. Get it right, and the gains you&rsquo;ve seen in the past year will compound. Get it wrong...

### [Designing Privacy-Safe Logging at Scale: Lessons from Building Compliance-Aware Observability Systems](https://devops.com/designing-privacy-safe-logging-at-scale-lessons-from-building-compliance-aware-observability-systems/)

**Source:** DevOps.com | **Author:** Vignesh Sundaram | **Date:** 2026-01-08 15:45 | **Reading Time:** ~1 min

🏷️ observability

As regulatory scrutiny increases and distributed systems grow more complex, many organizations have accepted that privacy-safe logging is important. Fewer have figured out how to actually build it without sacrificing observability, developer velocity, or incident response effectiveness. The failure mode is consistent: logging controls are bolted on late, enforced unevenly, and trusted only when no [&#8230;]

### [Autonomous, Resilient Workflows: How Close Are They to Reality?](https://thenewstack.io/autonomous-resilient-workflows-how-close-are-they-to-reality/)

🏷️ github, automation, observability, cloud, deployment

As enterprises push deeper into AI-driven automation, the conversation is moving from simple task automation to truly autonomous, resilient workflows. These systems observe, decide, adapt and act with minimal human intervention. But how close are they to mainstream reality? Enterprises have used scripted deployments, continuous delivery pipelines and streamlined incident management for years. But the industry is crossing into a new phase that is accelerating with the rise of generative and agent...

### [Kubernetes v1.35: Mutable PersistentVolume Node Affinity (alpha)](https://kubernetes.io/blog/2026/01/08/kubernetes-v1-35-mutable-pv-nodeaffinity/)

**Source:** Kubernetes Blog | **Date:** 2026-01-08 18:30 | **Reading Time:** ~4 min

🏷️ kubernetes, deployment

The PersistentVolume node affinity API dates back to Kubernetes v1.10. It is widely used to express that volumes may not be equally accessible by all nodes in the cluster. This field was previously immutable, and it is now mutable in Kubernetes v1.35 (alpha). This change opens a door to more flexible online volume management. Why make node affinity mutable? This raises an obvious question: why make node affinity mutable now? While stateless workloads like Deployments can be changed freely and th...
