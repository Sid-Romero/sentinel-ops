### [OpenTelemetry Collector vs agent: How to choose the right telemetry approach](https://www.cncf.io/blog/2026/02/02/opentelemetry-collector-vs-agent-how-to-choose-the-right-telemetry-approach/)

**Source:** CNCF Blog | **Author:** Neel Shah, Developer Advocate at Middleware | **Date:** 2026-02-02 12:00 | **Reading Time:** ~5 min

🏷️ cloud, microservices, prometheus, observability, pipeline

As cloud-native architectures continue to mature, observability has become a foundational requirement rather than an optional add-on. According to the Cloud Native Computing Foundation, OpenTelemetry continues to grow its contributor base and remains the second highest velocity project in CNCF, becoming the “kubernetes” of the o11y world. Its rapid growth and strong community momentum reflect accelerating adoption among Kubernetes and cloud-native teams. As organizations standardize on OpenTelem...

### [Durable Execution: Build reliable software in an unreliable world](https://thenewstack.io/temporal-durable-execution-platform/)

**Source:** The New Stack | **Author:** Charles Humble | **Date:** 2026-02-02 23:23 | **Reading Time:** ~11 min

🏷️ cloud, azure, security, reliability, aws

Software reliability is a persistent problem for developers because IT systems are built on unreliable components: hardware degrades; software has bugs; networks drop packets; large language models (LLMs) hallucinate; power fails. An executing program runs to completion unless: A. The program or OS encounters a bug B. An external failure, such as a machine losing power or rebooting, occurs C. There&rsquo;s a hardware failure Here&rsquo;s a small example that illustrates the problem. As I&rsquo;m...

### [Unlocking AI’s full potential: Why context is everything](https://thenewstack.io/context-is-everything-sales-force-data-360/)

**Source:** The New Stack | **Author:** Rahul Auradkar | **Date:** 2026-02-02 22:31 | **Reading Time:** ~4 min

🏷️ cloud, infrastructure

AI is ubiquitous in both the consumer and enterprise sectors. Yet few organizations are realizing AI&rsquo;s full potential. Why? AI agents must make decisions and take actions based on a limited subset of overall data. Result: too much guesswork, the occasional hallucination, and failure to extract full value from AI. The downfall of enterprise AI, then, is agents that falter without a comprehensive understanding of data, both customer- and business-derived. Companies need to be able to pivot f...

### [Why enterprise businesses should adopt immutable Linux for the desktop](https://thenewstack.io/why-enterprise-businesses-should-adopt-immutable-linux-for-the-desktop/)

**Source:** The New Stack | **Author:** Jack Wallen | **Date:** 2026-02-02 21:25 | **Reading Time:** ~4 min

🏷️ reliability, deployment, security

If you&rsquo;ve been a part of the Linux community for even a brief period, over the past few years, chances are pretty good that you&rsquo;ve stumbled across mention of &ldquo;immutable Linux.&rdquo; What does that even mean, and why is it important? The what and the why have profound implications for both end users and enterprise businesses. But what are those implications? Why is an immutable operating system so important to those truly concerned about security? Let&rsquo;s break it down. But...

🏷️ infrastructure, automation, terraform, pipeline, security

The new, revised Chainguard Factory 2.0 swaps out 1.0&rsquo;s fragile, event-driven pipeline with a self-healing system powered by a new open source framework called DriftlessAF. Lots of people love the software supply-chain security company Chainguard for its secure-by-design open-source components for today&rsquo;s application stacks. Who doesn&rsquo;t like components that come guaranteed to have the latest CVE fixes? These are built by a process called the Chainguard Factory. This is an autom...

### [OpenAI’s Codex desktop app is all about managing agents](https://thenewstack.io/openais-codex-desktop-app-is-all-about-managing-agents/)

**Source:** The New Stack | **Author:** Frederic Lardinois | **Date:** 2026-02-02 20:52 | **Reading Time:** ~3 min

🏷️ github

OpenAI is betting that coding agents are outgrowing the terminal. The company launched&nbsp;a macOS desktop app on Monday for its&nbsp;Codex software development agent, which&nbsp;focuses less on the code itself and more on managing multiple software development agents in parallel. Until now, the main way to interact with Codex was through the terminal, similar to Anthropic&rsquo;s Claude Code or Google&rsquo;s Gemini CLI. While the new desktop app still allows developers to drop into an IDE lik...

🏷️ devops

A survey of 418 DevOps professionals finds that while DevOps teams closely monitor and observe the performance of applications, not nearly as many are able to correlate the value of those efforts to the business. Conducted by Catchpoint, a unit of LogicMonitor, the survey finds more than two-thirds (67%) believe application degradations are either always [&#8230;]

🏷️ cloud, azure, gcp, automation, observability

AI unsurprisingly took center stage during the keynotes and throughout much of&nbsp;Dynatrace Perform 2026, the annual user conference last week in Vegas.&nbsp;But while AI now&nbsp;plays a profound role in&nbsp;DevOps, platform engineering, and IT in general, its role in observability is rapidly becoming critical for those who monitor systems and take action based on&nbsp;AI-augmented observability data. In Dynatrace&rsquo;s case, with the release of Dynatrace Intelligence, the company takes a ...

**Source:** The New Stack | **Author:** Max Liu | **Date:** 2026-02-02 12:00 | **Reading Time:** ~6 min

🏷️ cloud, infrastructure, pipeline, aws, reliability

For decades, distributed databases have been built around the assumption that storage will live close to compute. The farther data travels over the network, the reasoning goes, the greater the potential for delay. Local RAID (redundant array of independent disks) arrays, network-attached storage (NAS), and cluster file systems keep data close, making it quick and easy to access. But in a distributed system, keeping the entire data store close to compute makes scaling slow, cumbersome, and expens...
