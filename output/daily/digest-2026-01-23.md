### [Using MCP Servers: From Quick Tools to Multi-Agent Systems](https://www.docker.com/blog/mcp-servers-docker-toolkit-cagent-gateway/)

🏷️ docker, cloud, github

Model Context Protocol (MCP) servers are a spec for exposing tools, models, or services to language models through a common interface. Think of them as smart adapters: they sit between a tool and the LLM, speaking a predictable protocol that lets the model interact with things like APIs, databases, and agents without needing to know implementation details. But like most good ideas, the devil’s in the details. The Promise—and the Problems of Running MCP Servers Running an MCP sounds simple: spin ...

### [Your Dependencies Don’t Care About Your FIPS Configuration](https://www.docker.com/blog/fips-dependencies-and-prebuilt-binaries/)

🏷️ security

FIPS compliance is a great idea that makes the entire software supply chain safer. But teams adopting FIPS-enabled container images are running into strange errors that can be challenging to debug. What they are learning is that correctness at the base image layer does not guarantee compatibility across the ecosystem. Change is complicated, and changing complicated systems with intricate dependency webs often yields surprises. We are in the early adaptation phase of FIPS, and that actually provi...

On a surface level, AI agents aren&rsquo;t so different from microservices, according to Chris Aniszczyk, co-founder and CTO of the Cloud Native Computing Foundation (CNCF). The New Stack spoke with Aniszczyk about the AI and CNCF programs ahead of this year&rsquo;s KubeCon + CloudNativeCon Europe, set for March 23-26 in Amsterdam. &ldquo;If you think about what an agent is at a surface level, it sounds like a microservice,&rdquo; Aniszczyk tells The New Stack during this week&rsquo;s episode of...

SmartBear vice president of AI and architecture Fitz Nowlan explains why maintaining software integrity in the age of artificial intelligence requires organizations to double down on testing and quality assurance. He discusses how AI-driven development increases risk and why stronger QA practices are essential for reliable software delivery. Nowlan argues that AI-driven development increases risk [&#8230;]

🏷️ helm, reliability, pipeline

As AI coding assistants become more capable, the relationship between developers and their tools is evolving beyond a simple autocomplete. AI won&rsquo;t replace developers, but we need to rethink the way developers work with AI to maximize speed and quality. One highly effective approach is what I call the &ldquo;head chef&rdquo; model. Much like a head chef doesn&rsquo;t chop every vegetable or stir every pot, developers will no longer be writing most of their own code. Instead, they&rsquo;ll ...

🏷️ observability, monitoring, automation, deployment, reliability

In the past few years, agentic AI systems like AutoGPT, BabyAGI and others have demonstrated, through prompting, that large language models (LLMs) can accomplish a wide range of tasks, including planning, reasoning and executing multistep processes with little human involvement. They have shown that LLMs can do far more than simply answer individual questions and are capable of taking on more comprehensive autonomous problem-solving. The appeal has been both rapid and intense. Agentic systems pr...

🏷️ security, cloud, github

Late last week, the global cloud platform Cloudflare acquired the company behind Astro, one of the leading frontend frameworks. This follows a pattern of popular frameworks coming under the umbrella of platform companies &mdash; or at least becoming financially supported by them. This trend perhaps began in 2021, when Vercel hired Svelte creator Rich Harris. That same year, WordPress vendor Automattic acquired a React framework company called Frontity. In 2022, the global e-commerce company Shop...

**Source:** The New Stack | **Author:** Frederic Lardinois | **Date:** 2026-01-22 14:00 | **Reading Time:** ~4 min

Extracting data from enterprise tools like Salesforce, SAP Ariba, or NetSuite is relatively easy. Making that data usable for AI models to reason over is much harder. Just having massive amounts of tables and columns or giant multidimensional JSON files isn&rsquo;t going to help those models reason over that data. What&rsquo;s missing here is the business context in which the data was generated. Precog, which focuses on helping businesses extract data from Software as a Service (SaaS) API source...

🏷️ aws, security

Enough is enough. Daniel Stenberg, lead developer and founder of cURL, the popular, open source internet file transfer protocol, is closing down cURL&rsquo;s bug bounty program at the end of January. Why? Because cURL&rsquo;s maintainers are being buried in AI slop. In an interview conducted over Mastodon, Stenberg told The New Stack, &ldquo;It is our attempt to remove the incentives for submitting made-up lies.
