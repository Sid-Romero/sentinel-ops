### [Kubernetes as AI’s operating system: 1.35 release signals](https://www.cncf.io/blog/2026/02/23/kubernetes-as-ais-operating-system-1-35-release-signals/)

**Source:** CNCF Blog | **Author:** Angel Ramirez, CEO of Cuemby and CNCF Ambassador | **Date:** 2026-02-23 12:00 | **Reading Time:** ~4 min

🏷️ security, pipeline, infrastructure, reliability, cloud

Why v1.35 reads like an AI-infrastructure release Kubernetes has become the place where teams coordinate mixed production workloads: services, batch jobs, data pipelines, and ML training. The Kubernetes v1.35 (“Timbernetes”) release reinforces that trajectory with changes that reduce operational friction in scheduling, resource control, and configuration workflows. What stands out in v1.35 is practical: fewer restarts for resizing, new primitives for coordinated placement, and safer defaults for...

### [Gordon: Docker’s AI Agent Just Got an Update](https://www.docker.com/blog/gordon-dockers-ai-agent-just-got-an-update/)

**Source:** Docker Blog | **Author:** Srini Sekaran | **Date:** 2026-02-23 14:13 | **Reading Time:** ~3 min

🏷️ security, docker

AI agents are moving from demos to daily workflows. They write code, run commands, and complete multi-step tasks without constant hand-holding. But general-purpose agents don&#8217;t know Docker. They don&#8217;t understand your containers, your images, or your specific setup. Gordon does. Just run docker ai in your terminal or try it in Docker Desktop. Available today in Docker Desktop 4.61, still in beta, Gordon is an AI agent purpose-built for Docker. It has shell access, Docker CLI access, y...

### [Run OpenClaw Securely in Docker Sandboxes](https://www.docker.com/blog/run-openclaw-securely-in-docker-sandboxes/)

**Source:** Docker Blog | **Author:** Jennifer Kohl | **Date:** 2026-02-23 14:00 | **Reading Time:** ~5 min

🏷️ security, docker, cloud

Docker Sandboxes is a new primitive in the Docker&#8217;s ecosystem that allows you to run AI agents or any other workloads in isolated micro VMs. It provides strong isolation, convenient developer experience and a strong security boundary with a network proxy configurable to deny agents connecting to arbitrary internet hosts. The network proxy will also conveniently inject the API keys, like your ANTHROPIC_API_KEY, or OPENAI_API_KEY in the network proxy so the agent doesn&#8217;t have access to...

### [The Pentagon’s Anthropic problem is every enterprise’s AI problem](https://thenewstack.io/pentagon-anthropic-model-orchestration/)

**Source:** The New Stack | **Author:** Darryl K. Taft | **Date:** 2026-02-23 23:00 | **Reading Time:** ~4 min

The Pentagon&rsquo;s&nbsp;standoff with Anthropic raises a question for any CTO building on a single frontier AI model: If access changed tomorrow, how hard would it be to move, and what would that actually involve? Axios reports that Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth has summoned Anthropic CEO Dario Amodei to the Pentagon on Tuesday morning to meet over the Department of Defense&rsquo;s (DoD) use of Anthropic&rsquo;s Claude. DoD frustration The DoD is frustrated over the restrictions Anthropic ...

**Source:** The New Stack | **Author:** Frederic Lardinois | **Date:** 2026-02-23 19:51 | **Reading Time:** ~5 min

🏷️ aws, cloud, github

Amazon Web Services (AWS) is launching a dedicated GitHub organization for its most experimental agentic AI work. On Monday, the company launched Strands Labs, where teams across Amazon will publish frontier projects that aren&rsquo;t quite ready for inclusion into the production-ready version of the company&rsquo;s Strands Agents SDK. The initial release includes two projects: AI Functions, which generates code at runtime from natural-language specifications, and Strands Robots, which connects ...

### [Coding agents are only as good as the signals you feed them](https://thenewstack.io/coding-agents-feedback-signals/)

**Source:** The New Stack | **Author:** Arjun Iyer | **Date:** 2026-02-23 12:00 | **Reading Time:** ~7 min

🏷️ ci/cd, pipeline, observability, infrastructure, monitoring

The industry has spent the last few years optimizing AI agents&rsquo; code-generation capabilities. The focus has been on expanding context windows, fine-tuning models on repository-specific data, and developing complex prompting strategies. This has undoubtedly produced more capable coding agents. However, for most teams, that code-generation capability has not translated into significant gains in productivity. Most engineering teams are stuck in a manual workflow. The agent generates the code,...
