🏷️ security, cloud, automation, infrastructure

Over the past year, I&rsquo;ve met with customers and partners across every major industry, from healthcare and public sector to manufacturing and finance. No matter the vertical, the pattern is the same: The path to real AI value runs straight through your data infrastructure. Not through the biggest model. Not through a new cloud directive. But through the quality, governance and accessibility of the data beneath it all. That&rsquo;s why 2026 is shaping up to be a defining year, not just for A...

If you run a collection of servers, be they a home network lab or those powering your business, you are going to want to know the status of each server or service. That can be a real pain in the kiester if you have a lot of servers that you have to monitor regularly. Imagine if you had to log into each one of them individually to check on their status. Or, maybe you have several Docker containers that you need to keep tabs on to make sure they&rsquo;re up and running. If they go down, you might ...

Earlier this year, I wrote an article about how Java would soon overtake Python as the programming language of choice for AI app development. Back then, Simon Ritter, deputy CTO at&nbsp;Azul Systems, told me that based on Azul research, including a survey of Java developers, Java could encroach on&nbsp;Python&rsquo;s lead in use for AI development within a year and a half. In fact, Ritter said 2025 would be the last year of Python&rsquo;s dominance for AI development. So what can we expect in 20...

As software engineers rise up the ranks from junior levels to managerial roles in mobile development, good code practices become more apparent and not just an afterthought. One of the litmus tests of seniority is the ability to adapt to modern security practices. It is worth noting that as the mobile ecosystem moves fast, attacks on user data also evolve at the same pace. Therefore, it is the engineer&rsquo;s responsibility to modernize the remnants of legacy implementations, even if they still ...
