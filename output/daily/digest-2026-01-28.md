This Member Blog was originally published on the Isovalent blog and is republished here with permission. If you’re running Kubernetes, there’s a good chance you rely on ingress-nginx to route external traffic to your workloads. For years, ingress-nginx has been the go-to open source ingress controller, valued for its reliability and broad community support. Data collected from a recent State of Kubernetes Networking Report shows that 50% of respondents use Ingress-nginx today. But that’s about t...

### [The Role of Observability in Successful Cloud Migrations](https://devops.com/the-role-of-observability-in-successful-cloud-migrations/)

**Source:** DevOps.com | **Author:** Jenn Yarnold | **Date:** 2026-01-28 00:13 | **Reading Time:** ~1 min

🏷️ aws, observability, cloud

As organizations face rising VMware costs and tighter renewal timelines, migrating to AWS has become both urgent and complex. This article explores how an observability-first approach—spanning pre-migration planning, real-time execution, and post-migration optimization—helps IT leaders reduce risk, control costs, and ensure successful cloud migrations.

### [Open Responses vs. Chat Completion: A new era for AI apps](https://thenewstack.io/open-responses-vs-chat-completion-a-new-era-for-ai-apps/)

**Source:** The New Stack | **Author:** Janakiram MSV | **Date:** 2026-01-27 19:00 | **Reading Time:** ~5 min

🏷️ infrastructure, deployment, azure, cloud

The ability to build portable, provider-agnostic AI applications is the future of agentic development. For the past few years, OpenAI&rsquo;s Chat Completion API has been considered the de facto standard for interacting with LLMs. Major model providers, open source serving platforms, and AI gateways supported this standard. While this API served well during the stateless chatbot era, it falls short of many capabilities that agents expect. OpenAI officially transitioned from Chat Completion API t...

### [The agentic revolution: A new vision for SREs](https://thenewstack.io/the-agentic-revolution-a-new-vision-for-sres/)

**Source:** The New Stack | **Author:** Mandi Walls | **Date:** 2026-01-27 18:00 | **Reading Time:** ~4 min

🏷️ sre, security, reliability, devops

Site reliability engineers (SREs) are no longer an afterthought for harried IT leaders. They play a critical role in ensuring digital services work reliably at scale. But as complexity builds and incident volumes grow, SRE teams are being stretched thin by manual processes that degrade their value to the organization. This is where AI agents can help SRE teams break free of a reactive doom loop. When deployed strategically, agents can enable teams to move past toil and proactively enhance operat...

### [How to secure Vertex AI pipelines with Google Cloud tools](https://thenewstack.io/how-to-secure-vertex-ai-pipelines-with-google-cloud-tools/)

**Source:** The New Stack | **Author:** Advait Patel | **Date:** 2026-01-27 17:00 | **Reading Time:** ~5 min

🏷️ cloud, infrastructure, docker, deployment, security

AI models now power critical systems across many sectors. You&rsquo;ll find them in healthcare, banking, cybersecurity, and defense. When you move these models to production on Vertex AI, the attack surface grows fast. Your data, model weights, pipelines, and APIs all face risks. In this guide, you&rsquo;ll learn how to secure models built with Vertex AI, including data sources, model files, pipelines, and endpoints, using tools already built into Google Cloud. These include identity and access ...

### [Ai2 makes building custom coding agents easier and cheaper](https://thenewstack.io/ai2-makes-building-custom-coding-agents-easier-and-cheaper/)

**Source:** The New Stack | **Author:** Frederic Lardinois | **Date:** 2026-01-27 16:00 | **Reading Time:** ~3 min

🏷️ github

The Allen Institute for AI (Ai2) is launching a new family of open coding agents today that, as standalone models, outperform similar-sized models on standard benchmarks. But what makes this project stand out is that Ai2 is also open sourcing a collection of tools that lets anyone fine-tune the model based on their private codebases, documentation, and other materials for significantly better performance on domain-specific tasks. &ldquo;Over the past year, coding agents have transformed how deve...

### [RAG isn’t dead, but context engineering is the new hotness](https://thenewstack.io/rag-isnt-dead-but-context-engineering-is-the-new-hotness/)

**Source:** The New Stack | **Author:** Richard MacManus | **Date:** 2026-01-27 15:00 | **Reading Time:** ~7 min

🏷️ security, infrastructure, reliability

So, is RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) dead now? Last May I asked that question of Douwe Kiela, CEO of Contextual AI, based on the growing hype around MCP (Model Context Protocol). Both are data retrieval mechanisms for Large Language Models, but it&rsquo;s MCP that has taken all the headlines over the past year. The truth is, RAG has fallen away as a term used by developers and AI engineers. Even Kiela, who co-authored the 2020 academic paper that introduced RAG to the world, admits that a...

### [Chainguard EmeritOSS backs MinIO, other orphaned projects](https://thenewstack.io/chainguard-emeritoss-backs-minio-other-orphaned-projects/)

**Source:** The New Stack | **Author:** Steven J. Vaughan-Nichols | **Date:** 2026-01-27 14:15 | **Reading Time:** ~4 min

🏷️ github, infrastructure, monitoring, security, kubernetes

Open source has a problem. There are many under-supported, or even abandoned, open source programs that are still in wide use, but there&rsquo;s no one at the driver&rsquo;s wheel. To address this issue, Chainguard recently launched Chainguard EmeritOSS, a project to support these vital, but unloved, programs. After putting its support behind three different programs, the infrastructure security company is coming to the rescue of 10 more programs. Perhaps the chief one is MinIO, a lightweight, h...

### [QCon chat: Is agentic AI killing continuous integration?](https://thenewstack.io/qcon-chat-is-agentic-ai-killing-continuous-integration/)

**Source:** The New Stack | **Author:** Joab Jackson | **Date:** 2026-01-27 14:00 | **Reading Time:** ~7 min

🏷️ github, pipeline, aws, ci/cd

In the age of AI, will we still need continuous integration (CI) at all? One panelist in a QCon AI conference panel on AI and engineering asked this, perhaps deliberatively provocative, question: Will AI kill CI? While many at the event quickly dismissed the notion that AI could go&nbsp;that far as to actually eliminate CI, the question resonated in the halls of the conference, held within the scholarly confines of the New York Academy of Medicine in Manhattan&rsquo;s Upper East Side.&nbsp;It tu...

### [Cluster API v1.12: Introducing In-place Updates and Chained Upgrades](https://kubernetes.io/blog/2026/01/27/cluster-api-v1-12-release/)

**Source:** Kubernetes Blog | **Date:** 2026-01-27 16:00 | **Reading Time:** ~6 min

🏷️ reliability, cloud, infrastructure, deployment, kubernetes

Cluster API brings declarative management to Kubernetes cluster lifecycle, allowing users and platform teams to define the desired state of clusters and rely on controllers to continuously reconcile toward it. Similar to how you can use StatefulSets or Deployments in Kubernetes to manage a group of Pods, in Cluster API you can use KubeadmControlPlane to manage a set of control plane Machines, or you can use MachineDeployments to manage a group of worker Nodes. The Cluster API v1.12.0 release exp...
