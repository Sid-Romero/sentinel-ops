### [What CNCF Project Velocity in 2025 Reveals About Cloud Native’s Future](https://www.cncf.io/blog/2026/02/09/what-cncf-project-velocity-in-2025-reveals-about-cloud-natives-future/)

**Source:** CNCF Blog | **Author:** Chris Aniszczyk, CTO, CNCF | **Date:** 2026-02-09 18:20 | **Reading Time:** ~2 min

🏷️ infrastructure, observability, kubernetes, cloud, github

Ten years into CNCF’s journey, one thing hasn’t changed: we still rely on real signals—open source contributions, real-world deployments, and community energy—to understand where we’re headed. Cloud native is now invisible infrastructure, quietly powering our everyday lives. By watching the pace of project activity, we get a front-row seat to how teams are building the future. We dig into signals like commit frequency, contributor growth, community expansion, and deployment patterns to map where...

### [Cluster API v1.12: Introducing in-place updates and chained upgrades](https://www.cncf.io/blog/2026/02/09/cluster-api-v1-12-introducing-in-place-updates-and-chained-upgrades/)

**Source:** CNCF Blog | **Author:** Fabrizio Pandini, Broadcom | **Date:** 2026-02-09 12:00 | **Reading Time:** ~6 min

🏷️ infrastructure, security, kubernetes, cloud, reliability

Cluster API brings declarative management to Kubernetes cluster lifecycle, allowing users and platform teams to define the desired state of clusters and rely on controllers to continuously reconcile toward it. Similar to how you can use StatefulSets or Deployments in Kubernetes to manage a group of Pods, in Cluster API you can use KubeadmControlPlane to manage a set of control plane Machines, or you can use MachineDeployments to manage a group of worker Nodes. The Cluster API v1.12.0 release exp...

### [A practical systems engineering guide: Architecting AI-ready infrastructure for the agentic era](https://thenewstack.io/ai-ready-infrastructure/)

**Source:** The New Stack | **Author:** Oladimeji Sowole | **Date:** 2026-02-09 22:34 | **Reading Time:** ~7 min

🏷️ docker, gcp, infrastructure, security, terraform

The shift from traditional AI pipelines toward agentic systems marks one of software engineering&rsquo;s most important evolutions. Instead of static models answering isolated prompts, agentic systems can reason, plan, call tools, retrieve knowledge, execute actions, evaluate themselves, and collaborate with other agents. This emerging agentic era forces teams to rethink core infrastructure assumptions around statelessness, latency budgets, security boundaries, and cost attribution. Building AI-...

### [Salesforce Freezes Heroku Feature Development, Signals Long-Term Shift](https://devops.com/salesforce-freezes-heroku-feature-development-signals-long-term-shift/)

**Source:** DevOps.com | **Author:** James Maguire | **Date:** 2026-02-09 20:11 | **Reading Time:** ~1 min

🏷️ cloud

Salesforce has confirmed it is stepping back from active development of Heroku, creating a turning point for one of the cloud industry’s most influential platform-as-a-service offerings. While the company insists the service remains fully supported, the decision to halt new feature development and stop selling enterprise contracts to new customers indicates a broader strategic shift [&#8230;]

### [Is Open Source in Trouble?](https://thenewstack.io/is-open-source-in-trouble/)

**Source:** The New Stack | **Author:** B. Cameron Gain | **Date:** 2026-02-09 19:00 | **Reading Time:** ~5 min

First, the bad. I would argue that current open source practices and usage are not sustainable, or at the very least, there is a lot of room for improvement. In the current climate, there is a long litany of structural problems. These include how burnout is becoming a real possibility, as some of the most talented developers are working for free or with little &mdash; usually no &mdash; compensation, even though that compensation would be well warranted. Burnout is a real issue. Then, at a high ...

### [Chainguard’s AI-powered factory hits 500 million builds](https://thenewstack.io/chainguard-500-million-builds/)

**Source:** The New Stack | **Author:** Darryl K. Taft | **Date:** 2026-02-09 15:19 | **Reading Time:** ~3 min

🏷️ helm, security, automation

Just a week after Chainguard announced Chainguard Factory 2.0, the company has hit a major milestone that demonstrates the scale of the system now running in production. Last week, Chainguard said that its software factory, rebuilt around its DriftlessAF open-source agentic reconciliation, had produced more than 500 million unique container build manifests to date. DriftlessAF is an agentic framework that enables bots to use both traditional and agentic AI evaluation approaches to automate recon...

### [How AI coding makes developers 56% faster and 19% slower](https://thenewstack.io/how-ai-coding-makes-developers-56-faster-and-19-slower/)

**Source:** The New Stack | **Author:** Steve Fenton | **Date:** 2026-02-09 12:00 | **Reading Time:** ~8 min

🏷️ cloud, github, deployment, pipeline

There&rsquo;s a growing body of research around AI coding assistants with a confusing range of conflicting results. This is to be expected when the landscape is constantly shifting from coding suggestions to agent-based workflows to Ralph Wiggum loops and beyond. The Reichenbach Falls in Switzerland has a drop of 250 metres and a flow rate of 180-300 cubic metres per minute (enough to fill about 1,500 bathtubs). This is comparable to the rate of change in tools and techniques around coding assis...

### [Will AI Kill the OSS Star?](https://devops.com/will-ai-kill-the-oss-star/)

**Source:** DevOps.com | **Author:** Alan Shimel | **Date:** 2026-02-09 11:54 | **Reading Time:** ~1 min

As AI-driven development accelerates, open source software faces an uncomfortable paradox: Usage is rising while engagement, sustainability and community economics quietly erode. AI isn’t eliminating OSS, but it is reshaping how code is written, discovered and maintained. The result may not be the death of open source, but the end of its long reign as the default foundation of modern software.
