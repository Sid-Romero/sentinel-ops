### [How to solve the context size issues with context packing with Docker Model Runner and Agentic Compose](https://www.docker.com/blog/context-packing-context-window/)

**Source:** Docker Blog | **Author:** Yiwen Xu | **Date:** 2026-02-13 13:57 | **Reading Time:** ~8 min

🏷️ docker, helm

If you’ve worked with local language models, you’ve probably run into the context window limit, especially when using smaller models on less powerful machines. While it’s an unavoidable constraint, techniques like context packing make it surprisingly manageable. Hello, I’m Philippe, and I am a Principal Solutions Architect helping customers with their usage of Docker. In my previous blog post, I wrote about how to make a very small model useful by using RAG. I had limited the message history to ...

### [GitHub’s Agentic Workflows bring “continuous AI” into the CI/CD loop](https://thenewstack.io/github-agentic-workflows-overview/)

**Source:** The New Stack | **Author:** Frederic Lardinois | **Date:** 2026-02-13 14:00 | **Reading Time:** ~5 min

🏷️ github, ci/cd, infrastructure, security, automation

A lot of the hype around agents has been around writing code, but what if you could have an agent watch for events in your GitHub repo and automatically run a set workflow when, for example, a new issue is created? And what if you could just describe the workflow to the agent, and then have it generate the detailed steps for you? That&rsquo;s the question the GitHub Next team, the same team that also incubated GitHub Copilot, asked itself. In an interview with The New Stack, Eddie Aftandilian, a...

### [Why 40% of AI projects will be canceled by 2027 (and how to stay in the other 60%)](https://thenewstack.io/agentic-ai-connectivity-platform/)

**Source:** The New Stack | **Author:** Alex Drag | **Date:** 2026-02-13 14:00 | **Reading Time:** ~8 min

🏷️ security, observability, infrastructure, deployment

The agentic AI race is on, and most organizations are at risk of losing it. Not because they lack ambition, but because they&rsquo;re fighting three wars simultaneously without a unified strategy. Looking at what separates successful agentic AI programs from the 40% that Gartner predicts will be canceled by 2027, the pattern is clear. Organizations aren&rsquo;t failing at AI. They&rsquo;re failing at the infrastructure that makes AI work at enterprise scale. There are three underlying crises of ...
