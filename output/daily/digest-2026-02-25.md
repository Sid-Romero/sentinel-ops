Harbor is an open-source container registry that secures artifacts with policies and role-based access control, ensuring images are scanned for vulnerabilities and signed as trusted. To learn more about Harbor and how to deploy it on a Virtual Machine (VM) and in Kubernetes (K8s), refer to parts 1 and 2 of the series. While deploying Harbor is straightforward, making it production-ready requires careful consideration of several key aspects. This blog outlines critical factors to ensure your Harb...

When it&rsquo;s not distracted by negotiations with the Pentagon, Anthropic&rsquo;s focus has long been on the enterprise.

### [Databases weren’t built for agent sprawl – SurrealDB wants to fix it](https://thenewstack.io/surrealdb-3-ai-agents/)

**Source:** The New Stack | **Author:** Paul Sawers | **Date:** 2026-02-24 22:07 | **Reading Time:** ~5 min

🏷️ deployment, cloud

AI agents don&rsquo;t slot neatly into the way enterprise data stacks were designed. A typical agent needs transactional state (e.g., what just happened), long-term memory, similarity search, relationship-aware data, and the ability to react to data changes in real time. In most organisations, that means stitching together a relational database, a vector store, a graph engine, and layers of middleware to keep everything in sync. &ldquo;AI agents don&rsquo;t slot neatly into the way enterprise da...

### [OpenTelemetry roadmap: Sampling rates and collector improvements ahead](https://thenewstack.io/opentelemetry-roadmap-sampling-rates-and-collector-improvements-ahead/)

🏷️ cloud, monitoring, grafana, docker, infrastructure

OpenTelemetry has evolved over the last few years to become the de facto standard of choice for a rapidly growing number of organizations in need of instrumenting applications and standardizing telemetry data. It is designed so that the data can be understood by different observability platforms and visualization and storage systems of your choice. OpenTelemetry users&rsquo; wants and needs continued to serve as the DNA of the recently held OTel Unplugged EU following FOSDEM 2026 in Brussels ear...

Amazon Web Services (AWS) has added two additional capabilities to its Kiro artificial intelligence (AI) coding tool that promise to make it simpler to both create higher quality software in the first place and fix any bugs that might have inadvertently been included.

**Source:** The New Stack | **Author:** Oleg Danilyuk | **Date:** 2026-02-24 17:00 | **Reading Time:** ~6 min

🏷️ sre, pipeline, infrastructure, reliability, deployment

There is a failure mode so common in platform engineering that it barely gets mentioned anymore. A team ships a self-service workflow &mdash; environment provisioning, policy enforcement, automated approvals &mdash; and the thing works. Technically, it does exactly what it was scoped to do. Then, six weeks later, half the engineering org is still on old scripts, Slack is full of exception requests, and the platform team is in an uncomfortable position: either mandate adoption or watch their work...

**Source:** The New Stack | **Author:** Justyn Roberts | **Date:** 2026-02-24 12:00 | **Reading Time:** ~5 min

🏷️ cloud, github, ansible, ci/cd, infrastructure

Somewhere in the organization, there&rsquo;s a Jenkins job that nobody wants to touch. The job is mission-critical and deploys to production every Thursday. It was written three years ago by someone who&rsquo;s since left, references environment variables that may or may not still exist, and the only documentation is a Slack message that reads &ldquo;Just run it. It works.&rdquo; This is automation sprawl, and it&rsquo;s quietly bleeding the organization&rsquo;s engineering velocity dry. &nbsp; ...
