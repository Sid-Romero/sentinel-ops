### [What CNCF Project Velocity in 2025 Reveals About Cloud Native’s Future](https://www.cncf.io/blog/2026/02/09/what-cncf-project-velocity-in-2025-reveals-about-cloud-natives-future/)

**Source:** CNCF Blog | **Author:** Chris Aniszczyk, CTO, CNCF | **Date:** 2026-02-09 18:20 | **Reading Time:** ~2 min

🏷️ deployment, kubernetes, observability, github, infrastructure

Ten years into CNCF’s journey, one thing hasn’t changed: we still rely on real signals—open source contributions, real-world deployments, and community energy—to understand where we’re headed. Cloud native is now invisible infrastructure, quietly powering our everyday lives. By watching the pace of project activity, we get a front-row seat to how teams are building the future. We dig into signals like commit frequency, contributor growth, community expansion, and deployment patterns to map where...

### [Hardened Images Are Free. Now What?](https://www.docker.com/blog/hardened-images-free-now-what/)

**Source:** Docker Blog | **Author:** Jin Kim | **Date:** 2026-02-10 14:00 | **Reading Time:** ~7 min

🏷️ deployment, monitoring, security, pipeline, automation

Docker Hardened Images are now free, covering Alpine, Debian, and over 1,000 images including databases, runtimes, and message buses. For security teams, this changes the economics of container vulnerability management. DHI includes security fixes from Docker’s security team, which simplifies security response. Platform teams can pull the patched base image and redeploy quickly. But free hardened images raise a question: how should this change your security practice? Here’s how our thinking is e...

### [Survey: Java Developers Wrestling With Massive Amounts of Technical Debt](https://devops.com/survey-java-developers-wrestling-with-massive-amounts-of-technical-debt/)

**Source:** DevOps.com | **Author:** Mike Vizard | **Date:** 2026-02-10 14:00 | **Reading Time:** ~1 min

A global survey of 2,039 Java developers published today finds 63% reporting that dead and unused code adversely affects their team’s productivity, with 22% describing the impact of that technical debt as being severe. Conducted by Dimensional Research on behalf of Azul, a provider of a distribution of OpenJDK, the survey also finds that more [&#8230;]

### [Vibe coding is passé. Karpathy has a new name for the future of software.](https://thenewstack.io/vibe-coding-is-passe/)

**Source:** The New Stack | **Author:** Darryl K. Taft | **Date:** 2026-02-10 12:30 | **Reading Time:** ~3 min

🏷️ automation

The vibe coding guy is back, and this time he&rsquo;s talking about &ldquo;agentic engineering.&rdquo; Andrej Karpathy, who last year this time popularized the term &ldquo;vibe coding,&rdquo; now says that LLMs have gotten much smarter, such that vibe coding is now pass&eacute;. &ldquo;Today (1 year later), programming via LLM agents is increasingly becoming a default workflow for professionals, except with more oversight and scrutiny,&rdquo; Karpathy writes in a post he shared last week on X. &...

### [A practical systems engineering guide: Architecting AI-ready infrastructure for the agentic era](https://thenewstack.io/ai-ready-infrastructure/)

**Source:** The New Stack | **Author:** Oladimeji Sowole | **Date:** 2026-02-09 22:34 | **Reading Time:** ~7 min

🏷️ deployment, kubernetes, gcp, observability, prometheus

The shift from traditional AI pipelines toward agentic systems marks one of software engineering&rsquo;s most important evolutions. Instead of static models answering isolated prompts, agentic systems can reason, plan, call tools, retrieve knowledge, execute actions, evaluate themselves, and collaborate with other agents. This emerging agentic era forces teams to rethink core infrastructure assumptions around statelessness, latency budgets, security boundaries, and cost attribution. Building AI-...

🏷️ cloud

Salesforce has confirmed it is stepping back from active development of Heroku, creating a turning point for one of the cloud industry’s most influential platform-as-a-service offerings. While the company insists the service remains fully supported, the decision to halt new feature development and stop selling enterprise contracts to new customers indicates a broader strategic shift [&#8230;]

### [Is Open Source in Trouble?](https://thenewstack.io/is-open-source-in-trouble/)

**Source:** The New Stack | **Author:** B. Cameron Gain | **Date:** 2026-02-09 19:00 | **Reading Time:** ~5 min

First, the bad. I would argue that current open source practices and usage are not sustainable, or at the very least, there is a lot of room for improvement. In the current climate, there is a long litany of structural problems. These include how burnout is becoming a real possibility, as some of the most talented developers are working for free or with little &mdash; usually no &mdash; compensation, even though that compensation would be well warranted. Burnout is a real issue. Then, at a high ...

### [Chainguard’s AI-powered factory hits 500 million builds](https://thenewstack.io/chainguard-500-million-builds/)

🏷️ security, automation, helm

Just a week after Chainguard announced Chainguard Factory 2.0, the company has hit a major milestone that demonstrates the scale of the system now running in production. Last week, Chainguard said that its software factory, rebuilt around its DriftlessAF open-source agentic reconciliation, had produced more than 500 million unique container build manifests to date. DriftlessAF is an agentic framework that enables bots to use both traditional and agentic AI evaluation approaches to automate recon...
