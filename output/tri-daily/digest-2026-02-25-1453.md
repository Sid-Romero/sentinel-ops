We’re excited to announce the full list of Kubernetes Community Days (KCDs) for 2026! These community-organized events bring together local practitioners, adopters, and contributors to connect and share cloud native knowledge. Insights into the Selection Process We received an overwhelming number of exceptional KCD applications for the second half of 2026! With particularly high interest across South Asia and Europe, narrowing down the final list was a significant challenge. To ensure a fair and...

We’re excited to share a seamless new integration between Docker Model Runner (DMR) and Open WebUI, bringing together two open source projects to make working with self-hosted models easier than ever. With this update, Open WebUI automatically detects and connects to Docker Model Runner running at localhost:12434. If Docker Model Runner is enabled, Open WebUI uses it out of the box, no additional configuration required. The result: a fully Docker-managed, self-hosted model experience running in ...

### [What happens to a database when the user is an AI agent](https://thenewstack.io/databases-for-ai-agents/)

**Source:** The New Stack | **Author:** Max Liu | **Date:** 2026-02-25 13:00 | **Reading Time:** ~5 min

🏷️ helm, infrastructure, cloud, automation

In the past, we judged enterprise databases by how useful they were to people like us. We rated them on how well they helped architects create schemas, DBAs plan capacity, and analysts build queries. We expected databases to last a long time &mdash; years, probably &mdash; powering sales reports and quarterly projections, growing with the organization. &ldquo;But now comes a new kind of user: the AI agent. It has different needs. It operates at a different pace. It uses databases to do its work....

### [A Blog Post About COBOL Just Cost IBM $30 Billion. Here’s What Actually Happened.](https://devops.com/a-blog-post-about-cobol-just-cost-ibm-30-billion-heres-what-actually-happened/)

**Source:** DevOps.com | **Author:** Tom Smith | **Date:** 2026-02-25 07:52 | **Reading Time:** ~1 min

A single Anthropic blog post wiped billions off IBM’s market value—but the AI-driven COBOL modernization it described has existed for years. This is a case study in how AI hype, not fundamentals, is driving market volatility.

🏷️ observability

When it&rsquo;s not distracted by negotiations with the Pentagon, Anthropic&rsquo;s focus has long been on the enterprise. On Tuesday, it launched a set of new connectors and plugins for its business users that should make it easier for those companies to get value from Claude and Claude Cowork. Connecting Excel and PowerPoint The most interesting update &mdash; and one that many Office workers should be able to make good use of right away &mdash; may be about how Claude can now connect workflow...

### [Databases weren’t built for agent sprawl – SurrealDB wants to fix it](https://thenewstack.io/surrealdb-3-ai-agents/)

**Source:** The New Stack | **Author:** Paul Sawers | **Date:** 2026-02-24 22:07 | **Reading Time:** ~5 min

🏷️ deployment, cloud

AI agents don&rsquo;t slot neatly into the way enterprise data stacks were designed. A typical agent needs transactional state (e.g., what just happened), long-term memory, similarity search, relationship-aware data, and the ability to react to data changes in real time. In most organisations, that means stitching together a relational database, a vector store, a graph engine, and layers of middleware to keep everything in sync. &ldquo;AI agents don&rsquo;t slot neatly into the way enterprise da...

### [OpenTelemetry roadmap: Sampling rates and collector improvements ahead](https://thenewstack.io/opentelemetry-roadmap-sampling-rates-and-collector-improvements-ahead/)

**Source:** The New Stack | **Author:** B. Cameron Gain | **Date:** 2026-02-24 19:00 | **Reading Time:** ~4 min

🏷️ observability, microservices, infrastructure, grafana, deployment

OpenTelemetry has evolved over the last few years to become the de facto standard of choice for a rapidly growing number of organizations in need of instrumenting applications and standardizing telemetry data. It is designed so that the data can be understood by different observability platforms and visualization and storage systems of your choice. OpenTelemetry users&rsquo; wants and needs continued to serve as the DNA of the recently held OTel Unplugged EU following FOSDEM 2026 in Brussels ear...

🏷️ aws

Amazon Web Services (AWS) has added two additional capabilities to its Kiro artificial intelligence (AI) coding tool that promise to make it simpler to both create higher quality software in the first place and fix any bugs that might have inadvertently been included.

**Source:** The New Stack | **Author:** Oleg Danilyuk | **Date:** 2026-02-24 17:00 | **Reading Time:** ~6 min

🏷️ observability, infrastructure, pipeline, reliability, sre

There is a failure mode so common in platform engineering that it barely gets mentioned anymore. A team ships a self-service workflow &mdash; environment provisioning, policy enforcement, automated approvals &mdash; and the thing works. Technically, it does exactly what it was scoped to do. Then, six weeks later, half the engineering org is still on old scripts, Slack is full of exception requests, and the platform team is in an uncomfortable position: either mandate adoption or watch their work...

Harness today made generally available an Artifact Registry it has added to its portfolio of DevOps tools and platforms. At the same time, Harness also revealed it has added a Dependency Firewall to the registry that enables DevSecOps teams to enforce controls at the point of ingestion.
