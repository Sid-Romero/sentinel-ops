Customizing Docker Hardened Images In Part 1 and Part 2, we established the baseline. You migrated a service to a Docker Hardened Image (DHI), witnessed the vulnerability count drop to zero, and verified the cryptographic signatures and SLSA provenance that make DHI a compliant foundation. But no matter how secure a base image is, it is useless if you can&#8217;t run your application on it. This brings us to the most common question engineers ask during a DHI trial: what if I need a custom image...

If you&rsquo;ve never used Linux before and are considering it now, there&rsquo;s one thing you&rsquo;ll inevitably run into, and that&rsquo;s choice. With Linux, you can choose your distribution, kernel, init system, file system type, boot loader, default apps, and your desktop environment.
