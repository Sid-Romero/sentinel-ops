Harbor is an indispensable open-source container image registry, offering robust features like policy-driven security, role-based access control, vulnerability scanning, image signing, image replication and distribution. Deploying Harbor is a common and critical step for organizations looking to streamline their containerization workflows. Harbor offers significant value through its comprehensive features and can be deployed on a virtual machine.&nbsp; This blog post will pick up where we left o...

### [Why Cloud Optimization Is an Engineering Problem](https://thenewstack.io/why-cloud-optimization-is-an-engineering-problem/)

**Source:** The New Stack | **Author:** Vicki Walker | **Date:** 2026-01-05 21:00 | **Reading Time:** ~2 min

🏷️ cloud, reliability, pipeline, automation, kubernetes

You know the drill: Each month your organization&rsquo;s cloud bill comes in, higher than the month before, despite all your efforts to minimize overprovisioning and shutter idle workloads. Next thing you know, finance is storming into your department, and you&rsquo;re combing through the invoice, urgently looking for ways to bring costs down so you don&rsquo;t repeat this exercise again next month. All the work your organization put into FinOps was apparently for nothing. And you&rsquo;re at yo...

### [WASI 1.0: You Won’t Know When WebAssembly Is Everywhere in 2026](https://thenewstack.io/wasi-1-0-you-wont-know-when-webassembly-is-everywhere-in-2026/)

**Source:** The New Stack | **Author:** B. Cameron Gain | **Date:** 2026-01-05 19:00 | **Reading Time:** ~5 min

🏷️ cloud, azure, kubernetes, docker, infrastructure

WebAssembly made huge strides with the release of Wasm 3.0 and the component model. However, the last lap in the race to WebAssembly&rsquo;s true fruition is set to come with the planned release of WASI 0.3.0 in 2026, likely in February. Among other things, this final phase of standardization of the component model will mean that WebAssembly will be able to increasingly replace containers, which are not ideally suited for a number of applications, whether within Kubernetes or not. These include ...

### [Predictive Maintenance in Industrial Settings: Leveraging IoT and DevOps Practices for Maximum Uptime](https://devops.com/predictive-maintenance-in-industrial-settings-leveraging-iot-and-devops-practices-for-maximum-uptime/)

**Source:** DevOps.com | **Author:** Chris DeBrew | **Date:** 2026-01-05 18:55 | **Reading Time:** ~1 min

🏷️ reliability, devops

In modern industry, keeping machines running nonstop is a challenge. Systems grow more complex each year, yet expectations for reliability never relax. Predictive maintenance has emerged as one of the most effective ways to meet that challenge, allowing teams to see trouble coming before it causes a shutdown. The approach depends heavily on two complementary [&#8230;]

### [The Next Era of AI: From Single User to Team Collaboration](https://thenewstack.io/the-next-era-of-ai-from-single-user-to-team-collaboration/)

**Source:** The New Stack | **Author:** Kurtis Kemple | **Date:** 2026-01-05 18:00 | **Reading Time:** ~4 min

🏷️ helm, deployment

Most interactions today follow a familiar pattern: You open a chat interface, describe your problem and wait for a response. Because the AI has no context beyond what you provided in that single moment, users have learned to be exhaustive and precise in the way they prompt. This single-user, single-session model is about to fundamentally change. We are entering the era of multiplayer AI: Systems where agents participate directly in team conversations, maintain context across interactions and coo...

🏷️ pipeline, automation, monitoring, microservices, helm

Walk into an Amazon distribution center right now and you can feel the future humming. Thousands of robots glide across the floor, coordinating themselves like an industrial hive mind while human workers steer from the edges. Five years ago, this was a futurist&rsquo;s pitch deck. Today it&rsquo;s the baseline of modern operations. The shift isn&rsquo;t slowing down. McDonald&rsquo;s is upgrading 43,000 restaurants with AI. Retailers are swapping forklifts for fleets of autonomous bots. Agents a...

### [Why So Many AI Pilots Fail and How To Beat the Odds](https://thenewstack.io/why-so-many-ai-pilots-fail-and-how-to-beat-the-odds/)

**Source:** The New Stack | **Author:** Julie Banfield | **Date:** 2026-01-05 16:00 | **Reading Time:** ~7 min

🏷️ cloud, reliability, observability, pipeline, automation

In mid-2025, a widely publicized report claimed that almost all AI pilots fail. While there&rsquo;s been some debate around the reported failure rate, there are obvious reasons why some AI projects are successful while others never make it past the pilot stage. In my experience, much of what makes or breaks an AI project is connected to how well it&rsquo;s set up &mdash; from the start &mdash; to identify and fix the major operational challenges that can stand in the way of success. An Ideal Wor...

🏷️ security

Threat actors behind the virulent Shai-Hulud worm that wreaked havoc in open npm repositories toward the end of 2025 apparently are trying out a new strain that comes with slight modifications. Security researchers with Aikido Security, who have been tracking Shai-Hulud for months, wrote in a report that was updated January 2 that there doesn’t [&#8230;]

### [Tech Hiring in 2026: The Rise of the Specialist](https://thenewstack.io/tech-hiring-in-2026-the-rise-of-the-specialist/)

🏷️ cloud, kubernetes, security, infrastructure, github

I once worked with a boss who would refer to hiring job candidates as &ldquo;getting married.&rdquo; Are we ready to marry this candidate? Is that one a bad match? Yes, it&rsquo;s not exactly language to make an HR manager swoon, but the framework makes sense: Hiring means a long-term partnership where, ideally, both parties can benefit and grow together. But in 2025, suitors were dragging their feet &mdash;&nbsp;except when it comes to AI-related roles. Earlier this decade, companies love-bombe...

For OpenAI employees, asking a question even as seemingly simple as how many ChatGPT Pro users it has in one particular country can be surprisingly difficult, given that the needed data may be stretched be across multiple data sources, each of which is accessible in a slightly different way. Overall, OpenAI has 70,000 different data sets, amassing 600PBs of new data daily. About 3,500 employees can access this data, using any 1 of 15 tools. The company has always kept close count of its users, b...

Real AI gains don’t come from hype or pilots. They come from teams with strong teaching, mentoring and engineering culture already in place.
