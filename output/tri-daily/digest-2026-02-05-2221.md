### [How to control session routing for multi-IP hosts in Boundary](https://www.hashicorp.com/blog/how-to-control-session-routing-for-multi-ip-hosts-in-boundary)

**Source:** HashiCorp Blog | **Author:** Rachana Badekar | **Date:** 2026-02-05 18:30 | **Reading Time:** ~4 min

🏷️ security, infrastructure, terraform, cloud, azure

In Boundary, a dynamic host catalog is like an automated inventory system that discovers and manages infrastructure targets by syncing directly with cloud providers (such as AWS, Azure, or Google Cloud) rather than relying on manual entry. Instead of an administrator statically defining IP addresses, the catalog uses plugins to query your infrastructure based on tags (e.g. &quot;all EC2 instances tagged Environment=Prod&quot;). As VMs are provisioned or terminated, the catalog updates in near re...

### [Where on Earth is vibe coding taking off the most?](https://thenewstack.io/top-vibe-coding-countries/)

**Source:** The New Stack | **Author:** Darryl K. Taft | **Date:** 2026-02-05 21:03 | **Reading Time:** ~4 min

🏷️ aws, security

Despite talk of its impending demise,&nbsp;the&nbsp;vibe coding craze appears to be&nbsp;alive and well, particularly in Europe. A new study by vibe marketing website&nbsp;LeadsNavi analyzed Google search data to identify which countries are searching for vibe coding the most. The research examined both total annual search volume and searches per 100,000 residents, offering insight into where curiosity and adoption are most concentrated globally. Developers and non-tech users alike are looking a...

### [The one structural shift CISOs must make before AI outpaces their security strategy](https://thenewstack.io/federate-security-gitlab/)

**Source:** The New Stack | **Author:** Josh Lemos | **Date:** 2026-02-05 20:40 | **Reading Time:** ~4 min

🏷️ cloud, infrastructure, aws, security

Enterprise CISOs are stuck at a crossroads. Their budgets aren&rsquo;t growing fast enough, AI is sucking up every bit of enterprise data, and the software environments for which chief information security officers are responsible have become increasingly diverse and dynamic. Here&rsquo;s more bad news: These problems can&rsquo;t be solved by hiring more people, buying more tools, or working longer hours. The traditional centralized security model no longer scales. Instead, CISOs must now distri...

### [Open source USearch library jumpstarts ScyllaDB vector search](https://thenewstack.io/open-source-usearch-library-jumpstarts-scylladb-vector-search/)

**Source:** The New Stack | **Author:** Jelani Harper | **Date:** 2026-02-05 20:00 | **Reading Time:** ~5 min

🏷️ cloud, infrastructure, security, reliability

ScyllaDB, an open source columnar database, recently added vector search capabilities underpinned by USearch, an open source clustering and vector search library. The addition of vector search lets organizations store vector embeddings alongside structured data attributes in the same ScyllaDB table. Consequently, the low latency responsiveness of ScyllaDB becomes applicable to statistical AI-native vector embeddings for real-time applications of generative models, fraud detection, feature stores...

### [The enterprise is not ready for “the rise of the developer”](https://thenewstack.io/dynatrace-perform-rise-of-the-developer/)

**Source:** The New Stack | **Author:** Nick Lucchesi | **Date:** 2026-02-05 19:03 | **Reading Time:** ~2 min

🏷️ automation, observability

Asked what enterprises aren&rsquo;t ready for as AI advances, Sean O&rsquo;Dell of Dynatrace offers a prediction &mdash; and before doing so, admits it may get him in trouble. As a Principal Product Marketing Manager at Dynatrace, the observability platform used by hundreds of Fortune 500 firms, O&rsquo;Dell is privileged with oceans of data that help him identify trends more quickly and, yes, do a little fortune-telling when pressed. When The New Stack spoke with O&rsquo;Dell last week at Dynat...

### [OpenAI’s GPT-5.3-Codex helped build itself](https://thenewstack.io/openais-gpt-5-3-codex-helped-build-itself/)

**Source:** The New Stack | **Author:** Frederic Lardinois | **Date:** 2026-02-05 18:58 | **Reading Time:** ~3 min

🏷️ deployment, pipeline, monitoring, security

OpenAI&rsquo;s new GPT-5.3-Codex model is the company&rsquo;s most capable agentic coding model yet. However, unlike previous Codex models, it focuses not only on coding. With this model, which OpenAI made available on Thursday to its paid users across Codex-powered tools and APIs, the company has set a new goal: to create an agent that can write code and do everything else developers or any professional would do on a computer. OpenAI says that &ldquo;the model advances both the frontier coding ...

### [Anthropic debuts Opus 4.6 with standout scores for solving hard problems that other AIs miss](https://thenewstack.io/anthropics-opus-4-6-is-a-step-change-for-the-enterprise/)

**Source:** The New Stack | **Author:** Frederic Lardinois | **Date:** 2026-02-05 17:45 | **Reading Time:** ~4 min

Anthropic launched Opus 4.6 on Thursday, an update to its flagship Opus model that delivers major improvements over its predecessor&mdash;and many competitors&mdash;across virtually every benchmark. Opus 4.6 also adds several useful new features, including a one-million-token context window, the ability to output up to 128,000 tokens, and agent teams in Claude code that can work on tasks in parallel. Pricing remains the same as before: $5/$25 per million input/output tokens. A step-change for en...

### [It took a researcher fewer than 2 hours to hijack OpenClaw](https://thenewstack.io/openclaw-moltbot-security-concerns/)

**Source:** The New Stack | **Author:** Steven J. Vaughan-Nichols | **Date:** 2026-02-05 16:37 | **Reading Time:** ~5 min

🏷️ cloud, deployment, security

All those security fears about the OpenClaw AI agent and its social network, Moltbook, are already proving true, according to security researchers who have been cataloguing and reporting vulnerabilities. OpenClaw, the hot new personal AI Agent, may run on your local machine. Still, by default, it has full system access, can read files, execute commands, manage credentials, and work with external services via messaging platforms such as Discord, Slack, and Telegram. For the security-conscious, th...

### [10 strategies to reduce MCP token bloat](https://thenewstack.io/how-to-reduce-mcp-token-bloat/)

**Source:** The New Stack | **Author:** Bill Doerrfeld | **Date:** 2026-02-05 15:37 | **Reading Time:** ~10 min

🏷️ security, infrastructure, cloud, reliability, deployment

The Model Context Protocol (MCP) has reached an inflection point. While some MCP deployments are still in the experimentation phase, many are moving the technology into operational, day-to-day use. But as teams begin scaling MCP in real workflows, they&rsquo;re discovering that running many MCP servers simultaneously introduces severe bloat. Gil Feig, CTO and co-founder of Merge, a unified API platform, tells The New Stack that teams rushing to add dozens of tools are now hitting scaling problem...
