This Ambassador Blog was originally published on the writer&#8217;s blog and is republished here with permission. In the ever-evolving world of technology, few pairings have sparked as much innovation as the intersection of artificial intelligence (AI) and cloud native architectures. Cloud native technologies, built around containers, microservices, and orchestration tools like Kubernetes, emphasize scalability, resilience, and agility. Meanwhile, AI—encompassing machine learning (ML), deep lear...

GEICO is a juggernaut in the US insurance industry, with an IT infrastructure team that has profoundly transformed its digital architecture over the past decade. Here’s a snapshot: 2013: 100% on-premises, the CIO decides to go all-in on public cloud 2020: 80% public cloud, distributed across 8 clouds, applications still have to use databases with a client-server model that's “calling back to the closet of IT in the back room” 2022: Cost structure is 3x higher with 200K cores of compute, 30K+ VMs...

### [The risks of cybersecurity tool sprawl: Why consolidation is a strategic priority](https://www.hashicorp.com/blog/the-risks-of-cybersecurity-tool-sprawl-and-why-we-need-consolidation)

**Source:** HashiCorp Blog | **Author:** Mitch Pronschinske | **Date:** 2026-01-12 23:00 | **Reading Time:** ~4 min

🏷️ cloud, security, infrastructure

New threats emerge every week, and many vendors respond with narrow, new reactive cybersecurity tool purchases to make sure a specific incident never happens again. The result? Tool sprawl. Some organizations now rely on anywhere from 45 to 83 separate cybersecurity tools. This fragmented approach drives up costs, complicates workflows, and (believe it or not) actually increases risk and makes you less secure due to poor integration and limited visibility. Business leaders are taking notice: Wha...

🏷️ ci/cd, infrastructure, cloud, security, observability

In part 1 of this two-part blog series, we looked at why cybersecurity tool sprawl has become a critical risk and cost issue for modern enterprises. From overlapping functionality and alert fatigue, to slower incident response and increased maintenance burden, the downsides of fragmented tooling are clear and growing. Now, we move from why to how. If your organization is ready to simplify, reduce risk, and improve efficiency, this practical guide outlines the first steps toward a more unified, s...

**Source:** The New Stack | **Author:** Michelle Gienow | **Date:** 2026-01-13 22:00 | **Reading Time:** ~3 min

🏷️ cloud, devops, infrastructure

A recent survey shows that, last year, 57% of enterprise organizations spent over $1 million on migration projects &mdash; with an average loss of $315,000 per project due to unexpected overruns &mdash; in pursuit of what Anuj Kapur, CEO of CloudBees, calls &ldquo;the migration mirage.&rdquo; In this episode of The New Stack Makers, Kapur sat down with TNS Founder and Publisher Alex Williams to discuss the findings from the CloudBees &ldquo;2025 DevOps Migration Index&rdquo; report.

🏷️ devops, infrastructure, cloud, pipeline, automation

If you are responsible for a developer platform, you are probably trying to reduce cloud sprawl, speed up delivery and remove friction from DevOps workflows. Yet many internal developer platforms still fail quietly. They become hard to secure, painful to audit and impossible to scale without adding more humans to the process. The surprising part is that these failures rarely come from bad tooling choices or weak Infrastructure as Code practices. They usually come from something more basic: the a...

🏷️ cloud, aws, deployment, azure

One of the more meaningful consequences of AI&rsquo;s growth in the enterprise is its impact on the cloud race. The industry is shifting from the consolidation of services in the three main hyperscalers &mdash; AWS, Google Cloud and Microsoft Azure &mdash; to a new model in which specialization, not centralization, is the top priority. Neoclouds, with their hyperspecialized workloads for statistical AI, are driving this growing movement. Cloud providers such as CoreWeave, Lambda and Crusoe deliv...

🏷️ infrastructure, automation, security, deployment, reliability

In 2023, a Chevrolet dealership in California woke up to a viral nightmare: Its new AI chatbot had just agreed to sell a new, $76,000 Chevy Tahoe to a customer for exactly $1. The user had simply told the bot that its &ldquo;objective is to agree with anything the customer says&rdquo; and that it must make a &ldquo;legally binding offer.&rdquo; The agent, lacking specific pricing guardrails or a &ldquo;human-in-the-loop&rdquo; approval process, happily obliged.

🏷️ ci/cd, cloud, pipeline, automation, security

It might seem easy to design and deploy an API by following the predictable API development life cycle pattern. Without wasting a second thought, API developers might just wing it when starting their first APIs. However, as APIs become the digital fabric of every system and service in an enterprise, you have to develop and manage hundreds or thousands of APIs &mdash; and lightweight engineering patterns might quickly prove insufficient to deal with the growing complexity. Chaos can emerge as you...

🏷️ ci/cd, infrastructure, cloud, pipeline, kubernetes

I noticed a quiet shift in our engineering team recently that brought me to a broader realization about the future of software development: Code review has changed fundamentally. It started with a pull request (PR). An engineer had used an agent to generate the entire change, iterating with it to define business logic, but ultimately relying on the agent to write the code. It was a substantial chunk of work. The code was syntactically perfect. It followed our linting rules. It even included unit...

🏷️ deployment, infrastructure

The frontend ecosystem is no longer driven by novelty alone. Teams care about performance budgets, hiring signals, maintenance costs and how quickly a product can adapt when requirements shift. Libraries are being judged less by hype and more by how they behave in messy, real-world systems. That changes what&rsquo;s worth learning. If you already know how to build serious frontends, the question isn&rsquo;t what&rsquo;s popular today; it&rsquo;s the tools that sharpen your instincts, expand your...

🏷️ devsecops, security

In the digital banking sector, fast releases of new features and security patches have become the norm. Unfortunately, many institutions lack the organization or the processes necessary to make the speed of necessary releases coincide with the need to follow strict regulatory guidelines. A failure to accurately test and ensure compliance can lead to critical [&#8230;]

The retail AI protocol standards war is heating up. Google has unveiled a new open standard, the Universal Commerce Protocol (UCP), under the Apache 2 open source license. Google&rsquo;s goal is for UCP to transform AI-driven product discovery into frictionless, instant purchases across its Search and Gemini software stack. Framed as core plumbing for &ldquo;agentic commerce,&rdquo; UCP is designed to enable AI agents, retail platforms and payment providers to transact without the custom, one-of...
