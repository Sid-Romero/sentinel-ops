### [Docker versus Nix: The quest for true reproducibility](https://thenewstack.io/docker-versus-nix-the-quest-for-true-reproducibility/)

**Source:** The New Stack | **Author:** B. Cameron Gain | **Date:** 2026-02-07 18:00 | **Reading Time:** ~8 min

🏷️ aws, containerization, docker

When conducting performance benchmarks, the ultimate goal is an apples-to-apples comparison. Docker, widely recognized as one of the most brilliant inventions of the last 15 years, offers a level of reproducibility that allows engineers to share applications running on a test bed. Consequently, containers have become a practicable standard for replicating tests. However, significant caveats remain. When producing different applications for testing, containers often remain dependent on the host o...

We&rsquo;ve all experienced a frozen web page followed by endless refreshing, frustrated sighs, and the occasional foot stomp, only to keep seeing the spinning wheel. In many cases, this is caused by a bottleneck in JavaScript&rsquo;s main thread. The main thread is a single-lane highway where the browser processes everything in a strict sequence.

🏷️ infrastructure, security

The speed at which ClawdBot MoltBot OpenClaw climbed in popularity was quite phenomenal, and for good reason: It has an audience beyond the developer space, especially those who just want to experiment with digital assistance. Todays post continues my journey with GSD, but the LLM agent landscape is changing rapidly and this shooting star caught everyone&rsquo;s eye.

### [Memory-Safe Jule language emerges as C/C++ alternative](https://thenewstack.io/jule-open-source-programming-language/)

**Source:** The New Stack | **Author:** Darryl K. Taft | **Date:** 2026-02-07 16:00 | **Reading Time:** ~5 min

🏷️ infrastructure, security

With the U.S. government and other institutions calling for the use of memory-safe programming languages in critical systems, Jule, a nascent, open source alternative to C/C++ has emerged. The Jule homepage describes Jule as a &ldquo;simple and safe programming language with built-in concurrency, first-class C/C++ interoperability and powerful compile-time capabilities.&rdquo; Although the Jule project began in 2022 and is still in beta, its creation demonstrates that developers are looking at s...
