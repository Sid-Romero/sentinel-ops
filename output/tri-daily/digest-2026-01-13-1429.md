🏷️ ci/cd, kubernetes, microservices, cloud, security

This Ambassador Blog was originally published on the writer&#8217;s blog and is republished here with permission. In the ever-evolving world of technology, few pairings have sparked as much innovation as the intersection of artificial intelligence (AI) and cloud native architectures. Cloud native technologies, built around containers, microservices, and orchestration tools like Kubernetes, emphasize scalability, resilience, and agility. Meanwhile, AI—encompassing machine learning (ML), deep lear...

### [The risks of cybersecurity tool sprawl: Why consolidation is a strategic priority](https://www.hashicorp.com/blog/the-risks-of-cybersecurity-tool-sprawl-and-why-we-need-consolidation)

**Source:** HashiCorp Blog | **Author:** Mitch Pronschinske | **Date:** 2026-01-12 23:00 | **Reading Time:** ~4 min

🏷️ security, cloud, infrastructure

New threats emerge every week, and many vendors respond with narrow, new reactive cybersecurity tool purchases to make sure a specific incident never happens again. The result? Tool sprawl. Some organizations now rely on anywhere from 45 to 83 separate cybersecurity tools. This fragmented approach drives up costs, complicates workflows, and (believe it or not) actually increases risk and makes you less secure due to poor integration and limited visibility. Business leaders are taking notice: Wha...

🏷️ ci/cd, infrastructure, observability, cloud, security

In part 1 of this two-part blog series, we looked at why cybersecurity tool sprawl has become a critical risk and cost issue for modern enterprises. From overlapping functionality and alert fatigue, to slower incident response and increased maintenance burden, the downsides of fragmented tooling are clear and growing. Now, we move from why to how. If your organization is ready to simplify, reduce risk, and improve efficiency, this practical guide outlines the first steps toward a more unified, s...

🏷️ infrastructure, cloud, reliability, automation, security

The mandate to leverage data and AI for operational gain is forcing businesses to reckon with growing complexity in their IT infrastructure. As a result, leaders are now asking: What is hybrid cloud, and what role will it play in our company’s future? Increasingly, companies rely on a mix of public and private cloud infrastructure services, as well as systems they own and operate themselves. Done right, this hybrid architecture lets organizations connect on-premises solutions that still support ...

**Source:** The New Stack | **Author:** Steven J. Vaughan-Nichols | **Date:** 2026-01-13 14:00 | **Reading Time:** ~5 min

🏷️ cloud, github, infrastructure, deployment

The retail AI protocol standards war is heating up. Google has unveiled a new open standard, the Universal Commerce Protocol (UCP), under the Apache 2 open source license. Google&rsquo;s goal is for UCP to transform AI-driven product discovery into frictionless, instant purchases across its Search and Gemini software stack. Framed as core plumbing for &ldquo;agentic commerce,&rdquo; UCP is designed to enable AI agents, retail platforms and payment providers to transact without the custom, one-of...

🏷️ reliability, security

The first few years of generative AI in software development felt like a series of increasingly impressive magic tricks. We asked complex questions and seemingly perfect code appeared in an instant. That wide-eyed wonder and early success has morphed into an industry standard: 72% of developers who have tried AI coding tools now use them every day, according to Sonar&rsquo;s latest &ldquo;State of Code Developer Survey&rdquo; report. AI is no longer a tool for side projects; it is a primary driv...

🏷️ infrastructure, github, aws, deployment, security

If you ship AI applications, you have probably noticed that the questions are changing. Enterprise security questionnaires now include AI-specific sections. Requests for proposals (RFPs) require model cards and evaluation reports that didn&rsquo;t exist six months ago. Procurement teams expect documentation about system behavior and evidence that you have actually tested the system behavior. Federal large language model (LLM) procurement requirements will land in March, and EU high-risk AI oblig...

🏷️ security, github

For over 15 years, Kin Lane, co-founder and chief community officer (CCO) for open source API foundation Naftiko, has been building his expertise in APIs &mdash; not only the technical details but also the business angle. He believes that the growing use of copilots and agentic AI systems in enterprises means we must design and build APIs around business capabilities rather than resources. APIs should represent core business functions like &ldquo;manage inventory&rdquo; or &rdquo;process payment...

🏷️ pipeline, monitoring

It was Monday morning when our analytics team started noticing something wrong. Customer transaction volumes had apparently skyrocketed over the weekend, up 4,700% according to the dashboards. Impossible numbers were everywhere. Our fraud detection system was flagging thousands of suspicious patterns. The executive team was already asking questions. I pulled up the logs with a sinking feeling. Sure enough, our production data pipeline had processed Saturday&rsquo;s&nbsp;data not once, not twice,...

🏷️ terraform, observability, cloud, reliability, aws

When HashiCorp changed the licenses of Terraform and many of its other products from open source MPL 2.0 to the Business Source License (BSL), the backlash was intense. So intense that the community forked Terraform to create OpenTofu under a fully open source license. OpenTofu continues to gain ground, and HashiCorp (part of IBM since February 2024) has shown signs of stabilization, but the echoes of resistance still ring through the technology industry today. What this, and other high-profile ...

🏷️ aws

Refactoring used to be limited to a fixed set of transforms hardwired into IDEs. If the one you needed wasn&rsquo;t included, you were out of luck and had to do it the hard way. AI-assisted IDEs with Model Context Protocol (MCP) tool support have changed that game. Show them before and after examples of a wide variety of patterns, and they can figure out all kinds of transforms without explicit support for them. For example, here is a prompt I&rsquo;m using to clean up XMLUI apps that make unnec...

🏷️ ci/cd, kubernetes, gitops, pipeline, devops

Too often, GitOps becomes a victim of its own success. One cluster and one Argo CD instance quickly sprawl into 50 clusters and 50 Argo instances, held together by glue code and custom scripts. The isolation that made Argo CD secure in the first place translates into poor visibility and uncontrolled governance. Broken processes require your team to maintain custom dashboards and brittle orchestration scripts, wasting precious engineering hours that could be spent on more important projects. What...
