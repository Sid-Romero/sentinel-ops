### [Donald Knuth’s 2025 Christmas Lecture: The Knight’s Tours](https://thenewstack.io/donald-knuths-2025-christmas-lecture-the-knights-tours/)

**Source:** The New Stack | **Author:** David Cassel | **Date:** 2025-12-25 14:00 | **Reading Time:** ~9 min

&ldquo;It&rsquo;s that time of the year!&rdquo; read the email from Stanford Online. As he approaches his 88th birthday, Donald Knuth returned in early December for his special once-a-year &ldquo;Christmas&rdquo; lecture &mdash; a tradition he&rsquo;s been honoring for over 30 years. Stanford&rsquo;s beloved professor emeritus reminded his audience he&rsquo;s still writing &ldquo;The Art of Computer Programming&rdquo; &mdash; a legendary book he&rsquo;s been working on for over 63 years (releasi...

### [Sidero Labs Extends Talos Linux Directly to Broadcom VMs](https://thenewstack.io/sidero-labs-extends-talos-linux-directly-to-broadcom-vms/)

**Source:** The New Stack | **Author:** B. Cameron Gain | **Date:** 2025-12-24 21:00 | **Reading Time:** ~3 min

🏷️ cloud, infrastructure, kubernetes, deployment

ATLANTA &mdash; Sidero Labs&rsquo; Talos Linux was created to offer an alternative to the high cost and complexity of managing disparate Kubernetes and other deployments. It serves as a lightweight but highly scalable operating system designed for Kubernetes. In many ways, it does the opposite of Red Hat&lsquo;s Linux OpenShift, SUSE Rancher and other Kubernetes distributions. In all of these, Kubernetes is installed and runs on top of a general-purpose operating system. Sidero Labs, with its op...

### [Redefining API Management for the AI-Driven Enterprise](https://thenewstack.io/redefining-api-management-for-the-ai-driven-enterprise/)

**Source:** The New Stack | **Author:** Raghuram Tadipatri | **Date:** 2025-12-24 19:00 | **Reading Time:** ~7 min

🏷️ pipeline, reliability, monitoring, microservices, observability

For years,&nbsp;API management sat comfortably in the &ldquo;connectivity&rdquo; bucket of enterprise architecture. Teams focused on building, exposing and securing APIs so that mobile apps, partner ecosystems and backend systems could exchange information in a predictable way.&nbsp;API gateways enforced traffic rules. Developer portals drove consumption. Monitoring tools checked latency and uptime. But the rise of enterprise AI &mdash; especially multimodal foundation models, agentic systems an...

### [Scale LLM Tools With a Remote MCP Architecture on Kubernetes](https://thenewstack.io/scale-llm-tools-with-a-remote-mcp-architecture-on-kubernetes/)

**Source:** The New Stack | **Author:** Nikhil Kassetty | **Date:** 2025-12-24 18:00 | **Reading Time:** ~9 min

🏷️ pipeline, reliability, monitoring, observability, cloud

As AI systems move from experimentation to production, developers are starting to discover a new problem: The tools that large language models (LLMs) depend on do not scale well when they run on a single laptop. Early agent prototypes usually start with a simple local Model Context Protocol (MCP) server, which is perfect when you are exploring ideas, but these setups break quickly once multiple teams or real workloads enter the picture. I ran into this firsthand while building LLM-driven automat...

### [How To Get DNS Right: A Guide to Common Failure Modes](https://thenewstack.io/how-to-get-dns-right-a-guide-to-common-failure-modes/)

**Source:** The New Stack | **Author:** Sheldon Pereira | **Date:** 2025-12-24 16:00 | **Reading Time:** ~6 min

🏷️ security, infrastructure, monitoring, helm

This is the first in a two-part series. If you&rsquo;ve spent any time diagnosing outages or performance issues, you know that when nothing seems to work, &ldquo;It&rsquo;s probably DNS.&rdquo; The Domain Name System (DNS) remains the backbone of digital connectivity, quietly enabling every web transaction, application call and end user experience. Every click, app and transaction depends on DNS. It translates names to addresses so users can reach your services. But while the basics of DNS are w...

### [Best of 2025: AI-Generated Code Packages Can Lead to ‘Slopsquatting’ Threat](https://devops.com/ai-generated-code-packages-can-lead-to-slopsquatting-threat-2/)

**Source:** DevOps.com | **Author:** Jeff Burt | **Date:** 2025-12-24 15:00 | **Reading Time:** ~1 min

AI hallucinations – the occasional tendency of large language models to respond to prompts with incorrect, inaccurate or made-up answers – have been an ongoing concern as the enterprise adoption of generative AI has accelerated over the past two years. They’re also an issue for developers using AI-based tools when building code, including generating names of packages [&#8230;]

### [A Guide to Safe, Incremental Open Source Observability Migration](https://thenewstack.io/a-guide-to-safe-incremental-open-source-observability-migration/)

**Source:** The New Stack | **Author:** Marjorie Freeman | **Date:** 2025-12-24 15:00 | **Reading Time:** ~10 min

🏷️ pipeline, reliability, monitoring, observability, terraform

When people hear &ldquo;software migration&rdquo; or &ldquo;migrating away from proprietary agents&rdquo; they picture months of copying dashboards, rewriting alerts, redeploying agents and risky cutovers where something critical gets missed. The reality? With the availability of various open source tools, migrations can take weeks, not months or years. Open source can help you laterally shift and transition. This would allow you to transition to an open-standards-compatible, vendor-managed obse...
