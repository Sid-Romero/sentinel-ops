2025 brought significant developments in the cloud native landscape, with a strong focus on AI but new projects and end user reports in many other areas. As always, KubeCon is one of the key places we see the progress coming from project reports, end users showcasing their stacks and use cases or vendors in the sponsor hall. In this blog post, we start 2026 with a look back at the latest KubeCon+ CloudNativeCon North America in Atlanta, highlighting selected sessions from members of the CNCF End...

### [Permission-Aware RAG: End-to-End Testing with the SpiceDB Testcontainer](https://www.docker.com/blog/rag-permission-testing-testcontainers-spicedb/)

**Source:** Docker Blog | **Author:** Jennifer Kohl | **Date:** 2026-01-15 14:00 | **Reading Time:** ~8 min

🏷️ docker, pipeline, infrastructure, github

We use GenAI in every facet of technology now &#8211; internal knowledge bases, customer support systems, and code review bots, to name just a few use cases. And in nearly every one of these, someone eventually asks: What stops the model from returning something the user shouldn’t see?” This is a roadblock that companies building RAG features or AI Agents eventually hit &#8211; the moment where an LLM returns data from a document that the user was not authorized to access, introducing potential ...

🏷️ docker, cloud, github, security, infrastructure

AI-powered coding assistants are becoming a core part of modern development workflows. At the same time, many teams are increasingly concerned about where their code goes, how it’s processed, and who has access to it. By combining OpenCode with Docker Model Runner, you can build a powerful AI-assisted coding experience while keeping full control over your data, infrastructure and spend. This post walks through how to configure OpenCode to use Docker Model Runner and explains why this setup enabl...

### [Start Small and Go Big With Open Source Gonzo for Observability](https://thenewstack.io/start-small-and-go-big-with-open-source-gonzo-for-observability/)

🏷️ kubernetes, monitoring, cloud, github, deployment

Logs are essentially a language, and if you throw the right information into a large language model (LLM), it can help explain what happened. There is a hook in Gonzo where users can throw a log into their favorite LLM via backend APIs. This helps bubble up patterns such as repeated critical metrics and assists in pattern analysis and heat charts to separate the signal from the noise. As more code is created by AI, the complexity of logs is not getting simpler, necessitating a step back to look ...

🏷️ automation, aws, deployment, security, infrastructure

API sprawl hides both security dangers and missed opportunities. If an organization has more APIs than it can easily keep track of, those APIs can easily become entry points for malicious actors. And if those APIs are underutilized, they&rsquo;re not making the most of their potential to generate revenue. &ldquo;APIs run the core business process you want to scale,&rdquo; said Neeraj Nargund, who oversees the strategic partnerships for the automation brand at IBM, in this episode of The New Stac...

High-performance database system provider ScyllaDB has launched a new database cloud service that promises to rival the performance of Amazon Web Services&lsquo; DynamoDB key store, while costing only half as much, the company claims. The new service, called ScyllaDB X Cloud, uses the database&rsquo;s tablet-based architecture to rapidly scale up and scale down individual databases, using disk space more efficiently and speeding network transfers.

### [StyleX vs. Tailwind: Meta’s Take on CSS-in-JS Maintainability](https://thenewstack.io/stylex-vs-tailwind-metas-take-on-css-in-js-maintainability/)

**Source:** The New Stack | **Author:** Richard MacManus | **Date:** 2026-01-15 15:34 | **Reading Time:** ~6 min

Tailwind has been in the news lately, as it struggles to keep its doors open in the AI era. But it&rsquo;s not the only &ldquo;CSS-in-JS&rdquo; solution to compete for developers&rsquo; attention. Recently Meta has been promoting its open source, React-based styling project, StyleX. Unlike Tailwind, it&rsquo;s not a framework &mdash; Meta calls it both a JavaScript library and, more broadly, a &ldquo;system.&rdquo; But regardless, StyleX is yet another alternative to directly using the style she...

🏷️ security, cloud, infrastructure

Two years ago, I started experimenting with AI-assisted development tools. Today, they&rsquo;re embedded into daily workflows across our engineering organization. Getting there wasn&rsquo;t about adopting the latest model. It was about separating what meaningfully improves engineering outcomes from what adds noise. After integrating AI into production development at a large cloud infrastructure company, I&rsquo;ve learned that success depends far more on where you apply these tools than on the t...

### [Stop Wasting AI Investment on a Broken Change Approval Process](https://thenewstack.io/stop-wasting-ai-investment-on-a-broken-change-approval-process/)

🏷️ gitops, automation, pipeline, devops, deployment

Change approval has been a constraining force on software delivery for decades. With teams adopting AI coding assistants and agents, the quantity, size and complexity of changes is making a bad problem worse. For many organizations, investments in AI for developer productivity are failing to yield meaningful returns, and committee-based approval is often a contributing factor. Where organizations are unwilling to streamline their change approval process, investments in improving productivity els...

🏷️ automation, security, reliability

In 2025, the Ada programming language made what might be considered a comeback. (But don&rsquo;t call it one! Yet.) Last March, Ada broke into the TIOBE Index top 20 (reaching number 18), and by July, Ada broke the top 10 (reaching number 9 &ndash; its highest-ever position on TIOBE). It is now back to number 18. Moreover, this month Ada also broke into the top 10 in the PopularitY of Programming Language Index (PYPL), landing at number 9. While programming languages such as Python, C/C++ and Ja...

Anthropic&lsquo;s $1.5 million investment in Python security is both self-interested and smart, analysts say, addressing a critical vulnerability in the language that powers AI development everywhere. The Python Software Foundation (PSF) yesterday announced that AI safety and research company Anthropic is investing $1.5 million into PSF over the next two years. The investment will support the foundation overall, with a particular focus on Python ecosystem security. The Python software supply cha...
