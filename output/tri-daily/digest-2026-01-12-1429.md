### [New Mobile SDK Brings Low-Code Development to On-Device AI](https://thenewstack.io/datasapiens-sdk-the-low-code-way-to-build-on-device-ai/)

**Source:** The New Stack | **Author:** Richard MacManus | **Date:** 2026-01-12 14:00 | **Reading Time:** ~6 min

One of the big AI development trends of last year was the shift to on-device inference, in many cases using so-called small language models (SLMs). Google is leading the charge on this, with its &ldquo;Web AI&rdquo; initiative and technology such as LiteRT.js, its Web AI runtime. But this trend toward processing inference on the user&rsquo;s device isn&rsquo;t just browser-based. Last month, a company called DataSapien launched a software development kit (SDK) for mobile development of on-device...

### [When To Use GenAI: A Practical Decision Framework](https://thenewstack.io/when-to-use-genai-a-practical-decision-framework/)

**Source:** The New Stack | **Author:** Venkata Karumuri | **Date:** 2026-01-11 18:00 | **Reading Time:** ~6 min

🏷️ reliability, infrastructure, deployment

As generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) capabilities evolve, software architects and developers face critical decisions about when to use GenAI-based solutions versus traditional programming approaches. A systematic, four-dimensional decision framework guides technology selection in application design. While traditional programming offers faster implementation for straightforward tasks with full transparency, GenAI-based solutions demand significant computational resources and training tim...

### [The Key to Agentic Success? BASH Is All You Need](https://thenewstack.io/the-key-to-agentic-success-let-unix-bash-lead-the-way/)

**Source:** The New Stack | **Author:** Joab Jackson | **Date:** 2026-01-11 15:00 | **Reading Time:** ~6 min

🏷️ observability, pipeline

Agent builders are finding that sometimes the easiest way for an agent to do its job is to simply give it a few Unix tools and &ldquo;let it cook.&rdquo; A recent project from Vercel found that stripping away loads of metadata and instead giving the model a BASH shell and access to data produced superior results. And another group of open source developers is finding that a simple BASH while loop and some time alone is all that is needed to execute even complex tasks. &ldquo;Models are getting s...
