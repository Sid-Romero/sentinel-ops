🏷️ github, infrastructure, docker, cloud

Personal AI assistants are transforming how we manage our daily lives—from handling emails and calendars to automating smart homes. However, as these assistants gain more access to our private data, concerns about privacy, data residency, and long-term costs are at an all-time high. By combining Clawdbot with Docker Model Runner (DMR), you can build a high-performance, agentic personal assistant while keeping full control over your data, infrastructure, and spending. This post walks through how ...

### [How resilient is HCP Vault during real AWS regional outages?](https://www.hashicorp.com/blog/how-resilient-is-hcp-vault-during-real-aws-regional-outages)

**Source:** HashiCorp Blog | **Author:** Harini Murugan | **Date:** 2026-01-26 17:00 | **Reading Time:** ~5 min

🏷️ infrastructure, automation, aws, azure, cloud

On October 20, 2025, a significant service disruption affected AWS us-east-1, impacting numerous services across the cloud ecosystem. This event provided a real-world validation of HashiCorp Cloud Platform (HCP) Vault Dedicated's architectural design principles. At approximately 7:00 AM UTC, the HCP Vault control plane (hosted in us-east-1 and serving both AWS and Azure data planes) experienced elevated HTTP 500 error rates and intermittent panics. Even in the midst of this AWS us-east1 disrupti...

### [Chainguard EmeritOSS backs MinIO, other orphaned projects](https://thenewstack.io/chainguard-emeritoss-backs-minio-other-orphaned-projects/)

**Source:** The New Stack | **Author:** Steven J. Vaughan-Nichols | **Date:** 2026-01-27 14:15 | **Reading Time:** ~4 min

🏷️ github, monitoring, infrastructure, prometheus, kubernetes

Open source has a problem. There are many under-supported, or even abandoned, open source programs that are still in wide use, but there&rsquo;s no one at the driver&rsquo;s wheel. To address this issue, Chainguard recently launched Chainguard EmeritOSS, a project to support these vital, but unloved, programs. After putting its support behind three different programs, the infrastructure security company is coming to the rescue of 10 more programs. Perhaps the chief one is MinIO, a lightweight, h...

### [QCon chat: Is agentic AI killing continuous integration?](https://thenewstack.io/qcon-chat-is-agentic-ai-killing-continuous-integration/)

**Source:** The New Stack | **Author:** Joab Jackson | **Date:** 2026-01-27 14:00 | **Reading Time:** ~7 min

🏷️ github, pipeline, ci/cd, aws

In the age of AI, will we still need continuous integration (CI) at all? One panelist in a QCon AI conference panel on AI and engineering asked this, perhaps deliberatively provocative, question: Will AI kill CI? While many at the event quickly dismissed the notion that AI could go&nbsp;that far as to actually eliminate CI, the question resonated in the halls of the conference, held within the scholarly confines of the New York Academy of Medicine in Manhattan&rsquo;s Upper East Side.&nbsp;It tu...

🏷️ devops, reliability

AI agents aren’t chatbots—they’re systems that act. This guide cuts through the hype to show how DevOps teams can configure, trust, and run AI agents reliably in production.

### [BellSoft bets Java expertise can beat hardened container wave](https://thenewstack.io/bellsoft-bets-java-expertise-can-beat-hardened-container-wave/)

**Source:** The New Stack | **Author:** Darryl K. Taft | **Date:** 2026-01-26 23:00 | **Reading Time:** ~5 min

🏷️ aws, azure, cloud, docker, security

The hardened container market has been heating up with venture money and startups, but Java platform provider BellSoft thinks its eight years of building Java runtimes gives it something others don&rsquo;t have: expertise in what&rsquo;s actually running inside those secured containers. The company used the KubeCon conference in Atlanta last November to launch its BellSoft Hardened Images, betting it can stand out in a space where Chainguard pioneered the approach, and startups are now piling in...

### [AI DevOps vs. SRE agents: Compare AI incident response tools](https://thenewstack.io/ai-devops-vs-sre-agents-compare-ai-incident-response-tools/)

**Source:** The New Stack | **Author:** Fahmid Kabir | **Date:** 2026-01-26 19:00 | **Reading Time:** ~6 min

🏷️ observability, devops, monitoring, ci/cd, infrastructure

If you&rsquo;ve seen a new crop of data about ops lately, you may have noticed this new category coming up: AI agents that promise to take charge of incident intervention, diagnose the root cause, and even solve problems themselves. AWS&nbsp;announced one. Microsoft has one. A dozen startups are creating them. And the terminology is, to put it mildly, an inconsistent affair: AI DevOps engineer, AI site reliability engineering (SRE) agent, AIOps platform. Are these the same thing? Different thing...

### [Async Rust: Pinning demystified](https://thenewstack.io/async-rust-pinning-demystified/)

**Source:** The New Stack | **Author:** Anshul Gupta | **Date:** 2026-01-26 19:00 | **Reading Time:** ~7 min

This is the second of a four-part series. Read Part 1: How Rust does Async differently (and why it matters) In the previous part of this series, we explored the &ldquo;pull-based&rdquo; model of Rust&rsquo;s asynchronous engine. We saw how the compiler transforms async functions into lazy state machines that only make progress when polled by an executor. However, if you looked closely at the poll method signature we implemented for our CountdownFuture, you might have noticed a peculiar wrapper a...

### [Anthropic extends MCP with a UI framework](https://thenewstack.io/anthropic-extends-mcp-with-an-app-framework/)

**Source:** The New Stack | **Author:** Frederic Lardinois | **Date:** 2026-01-26 18:00 | **Reading Time:** ~3 min

🏷️ monitoring, security

With the MCP protocol, Anthropic created the de facto standard for AI models and agents to talk to third-party applications. After donating the MCP protocol to the Agentic AI Foundation last December, Anthropic today released a major new open extension to MCP that will allow MCP servers to serve up an interactive app-like experience right within the chat interface. Anthropic, of course, is building this feature right into the web and desktop experiences for Claude. It&rsquo;s worth stressing, ho...

### [Cisco is using eBPF to rethink firewalls, vulnerability mitigation](https://thenewstack.io/cisco-is-using-ebpf-to-rethink-firewalls-vulnerability-mitigation/)

**Source:** The New Stack | **Author:** Joab Jackson | **Date:** 2026-01-26 17:00 | **Reading Time:** ~6 min

🏷️ observability, deployment, infrastructure, kubernetes, cloud

Networking giant Cisco purchased Isovalent in 2024 to get in on the cloud native action. In our cloud native community, Isovalent was primarily known for Cilium, an Extended Berkeley Packet Filter (eBPF) overlay network that worked well for Kubernetes environments, namely by replacing IP tables with in-kernel traffic routing by eBPF. The company also&nbsp;built Tetragon, a vulnerability mitigation platform that Cisco has already embedded into its own smart switch software. Today, Cisco is one of...

### [How open standards enable zero trust on commodity hardware](https://thenewstack.io/how-open-standards-enable-zero-trust-on-commodity-hardware/)

**Source:** The New Stack | **Author:** Marina Moore | **Date:** 2026-01-26 16:00 | **Reading Time:** ~6 min

🏷️ deployment, infrastructure, microservices, cloud, security

Confidential computing has always held a certain promise. The idea that workloads could process sensitive data while remaining isolated even from the infrastructure that runs them has reshaped the way many enterprise security teams think about trust. For years, we have accepted that data should be encrypted at rest and in transit, but data in use has remained exposed to the platform beneath it. Confidential computing proposes to close that gap. What has slowed adoption is not a lack of interest ...

Just because AI is writing your code doesn&#8217;t mean you can stop worrying about software bills of materials. While the quality of AI coding remains open to debate, there&#8217;s no question that everyone and their dog is using it. That means, if you&#8217;re serious about using AI in production, you must track its code in [&#8230;]

### [A security checklist for your React and Next.js apps](https://thenewstack.io/a-security-checklist-for-your-react-and-next-js-apps/)

**Source:** The New Stack | **Author:** Crystal Morin | **Date:** 2026-01-26 15:00 | **Reading Time:** ~5 min

🏷️ ci/cd, infrastructure, aws, cloud, security

Modern cloud native attacks don&rsquo;t always rely on a single breakthrough exploit. Instead, threat actors chain together small assumptions, overlooked behaviors, and trusted components in ways defenders least expect. The recent React2Shell vulnerability is a perfect example of this, and the EtherRAT malware shows just how creative adversaries are. For teams that rely on React, the React2Shell vulnerability was a wake-up call. It doesn&rsquo;t just affect React as a framework; it breaks assump...
