🏷️ docker, security, github

The Docker run command is a great introduction to running containers. It&rsquo;s simple, it&rsquo;s quick, and it&rsquo;s fairly easy to learn. It&rsquo;s also a bit limiting. For one thing, those run commands can grow quite long, and just viewing them in your terminal window can be a real challenge. As well, it&rsquo;s harder to edit those commands before running them. You might want to alter the port, which means you&rsquo;ll need to use your keyboard arrow keys to navigate back, one character...

The transition from running machine learning models in Colab notebooks to operational, high-traffic applications requires significant changes in infrastructure setup. The notebook environment maintains fixed dependencies that become inactive when the kernel stops. Fortunately, users can easily restart it.

AI is the epitome of moving fast and breaking things. But where has the rigor gone, asks Thoughtworks CTO Rachel Laycock. Where are the guardrails? AI may be dubbed the great disruptor, but it&rsquo;s really just an accelerator of whatever you already have. The 2025 DORA report places AI&rsquo;s primary role in software development as that of an amplifier &mdash; a funhouse mirror that reflects back the good, bad, and ugly of your whole pipeline. AI is proven to be impactful on the individual de...

Anthropic on Tuesday launched Claude Sonnet 4.6, the latest version of its mainstream model. This new version promises to almost match the company&rsquo;s flagship Opus 4.6 model, which launched barely two weeks ago, in most tasks, but at the significantly lower price of $3/$15 per million input/output tokens (compared to $5/$25 for the Opus model). Just like the previous version and Opus 4.6, Sonnet 4.6 offers a 1-million-token context window in beta. Benchmarks Compared to the older Sonnet mod...

Some days it feels like we are living in an XKCD cartoon. xkcd.com Organizations don&rsquo;t typically migrate legacy systems from one spec to another as new ideas emerge. Instead, they accumulate layers of integration standards over time, with each era leaving behind systems that are too costly or risky to excavate. &ldquo;I get a call from a ...

### ArgoCD v3.3.1

**Repository:** argoproj/argo-cd | **Date:** 2026-02-18 12:30 | **Assets:** 11

[View Release](https://github.com/argoproj/argo-cd/releases/tag/v3.3.1)

#### 📌 Key Highlights

🚨 **Breaking Changes:**
- > https://argo-cd.readthedocs.io/en/stable/operator-manual/upgrading/3.2-3.3/#breaking-changes

✨ **New Features:**
- > A temporary remediation is to additionally set the `ClientSideApplyMigration=false` sync option on this Application. This solution is temporary and not recommended for the long run because it may result in conflicts between Argo CD K8s field manager and other field managers at a later point in time, and if you use it, you will need to remove it after the above issue is fixed.

🐛 **Bug Fixes:**
- > We are currently working on a long-term fix to this issue, the progress can be tracked here: https://github.com/argoproj/argo-cd/issues/26279
