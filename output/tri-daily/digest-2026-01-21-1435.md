🏷️ kubernetes, cloud, deployment, security, pipeline

The CNCF Annual Cloud Native Survey confirms a long-developing trend: Kubernetes has moved from container orchestration to becoming the backbone of modern infrastructure—including AI. Production usage of Kubernetes now stands at 82% among container users, and 66% of AI adopters are using it to scale inference workloads. Kubernetes is no longer a niche tool; it’s a core infrastructure layer supporting scale, reliability, and increasingly AI systems. This shift reflects both the technical evolutio...

### [How Rust does Async differently (and why it matters)](https://thenewstack.io/how-rust-does-async-differently-and-why-it-matters/)

**Source:** The New Stack | **Author:** Anshul Gupta | **Date:** 2026-01-21 14:00 | **Reading Time:** ~6 min

This is the first of a four-part series. If you are coming from JavaScript, Python or Go, Rust&rsquo;s asynchronous model can feel like a bit of a culture shock. In those languages, the runtime is a &ldquo;black box&rdquo; that just works. In Rust, the hood is wide open, and the engine looks very different. Why learn this? Most developers &ldquo;use&rdquo; async. Very few understand it. By peeling back the layers of Rust&rsquo;s implementation, you aren&rsquo;t just learning a language; you&rsqu...

🏷️ security

The steady buildout of vibe-coded applications into production will lead to catastrophic problems for organizations that don&rsquo;t properly review AI-developed software, a software security expert predicts. David Mytton, founder and CEO of developer security provider Arcjet, writes in a LinkedIn post: &ldquo;In 2026, I expect more and more vibe-coded applications hitting production in a big way. That&rsquo;s going to be great for velocity &hellip; but you&rsquo;ve still got to pay attention. T...

🏷️ devops, ci/cd, cloud, pipeline, reliability

For most platform engineering teams, internal developer portals are considered the best way to solve DevOps scalability challenges. The ability to instantly spin up a new pipeline by cloning a template has been a game-changer for development teams. With just the push of a button, a developer can set up a new pipeline with all the workflows, toolchains, and resources they need to create a new application. It almost feels like magic. But this Day 1 speed often comes with a major Day 2 problem: ope...

Coming off a great holiday break, full of eggnog-induced reflection and an eagerness to get this year rolling, I couldn&rsquo;t resist a quick (and slightly self-congratulatory) look back at my 2025 trend predictions. Let&rsquo;s see if I deserve a crystal ball or just a cheap plastic one. Here&rsquo;s a lightning recap of the 2025 Top Trends, just in case you haven&rsquo;t memorized them: 2025: A Look Back Generative AI will supercharge software development.

### [WebAssembly vs. JavaScript: Testing Side-by-Side Performance](https://thenewstack.io/webassembly-vs-javascript-testing-side-by-side-performance/)

**Source:** The New Stack | **Author:** Jessica Wachtel | **Date:** 2026-01-20 17:00 | **Reading Time:** ~4 min

When we talk about WebAssembly&nbsp;(Wasm), we often describe it as &ldquo;near-native speed&rdquo; and &ldquo;faster than JavaScript.&rdquo; But what does that actually look like in practice? Before we get into where Wasm excels, let&rsquo;s level-set: JavaScript is still a developer&rsquo;s best friend when it comes to UI. It was built to manipulate the DOM (the web&rsquo;s Document Object Model) and handle CSS updates, and it does that job successfully. But we&rsquo;re watching the demands of...

🏷️ reliability, security

Before the hype around Model Context Protocol (MCP) had a chance to die down, Anthropic pulled another winner out of its hat: Agent Skills. Agents are full decision-making entities with system prompts, tool access, backing models (Claude, ChatGPT, etc.) and agentic loops that let them orchestrate workflows and manage state. The new Agent Skills are modular, declarative bundles of expertise &mdash; organized procedural knowledge packaged into reusable units that agents load progressively as neede...

🏷️ kubernetes, cloud, prometheus, deployment, terraform

Agentic AI has shifted from toy demos to the front lines of real products: autonomous research assistants, compliance copilots, ops bots that watch dashboards and file tickets, and Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) copilots wired to enterprise data. The problem is not &ldquo;can we make an agent do something clever once?&rdquo; Rather, it&rsquo;s &ldquo;can we make agents reliable, observable, cost-aware, and safe every time?&rdquo; Achieving this requires a comprehensive, production-focused ...
