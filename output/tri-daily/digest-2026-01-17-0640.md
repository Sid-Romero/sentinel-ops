🏷️ reliability, security, kubernetes, cloud

The Open Source Technology Improvement Fund is proud to share the results of our security audit of CRI-O. CRI-O is an implementation of the Kubernetes Container Runtime Interface (CRI) that is OCI-compliant (-O) that provides the backend between OCI-format container images and the Kubernetes control plane. With the help of X41 D-Sec and the Cloud Native Computing Foundation (CNCF), CRI-O completed their second security audit with OSTIF. Audit Process: This security engagement took place in late ...

### [Making (Very) Small LLMs Smarter](https://www.docker.com/blog/making-small-llms-smarter/)

**Source:** Docker Blog | **Author:** Yiwen Xu | **Date:** 2026-01-16 13:47 | **Reading Time:** ~19 min

🏷️ github, docker

Hello, I’m Philippe, and I am a Principal Solutions Architect helping customers with their usage of Docker. I started getting seriously interested in generative AI about two years ago. What interests me most is the ability to run language models (LLMs) directly on my laptop (For work, I have a MacBook Pro M2 max, but on a more personal level, I run LLMs on my personal MacBook Air M4 and on Raspberry Pis &#8211; yes, it&#8217;s possible, but I&#8217;ll talk about that another time). Let&#8217;s b...

### [Arcjet’s Python SDK Embeds Security in Code](https://thenewstack.io/arcjets-python-sdk-embeds-security-in-code/)

**Source:** The New Stack | **Author:** Darryl K. Taft | **Date:** 2026-01-16 22:00 | **Reading Time:** ~3 min

🏷️ deployment, security

Security platform provider Arcjet has launched a Python SDK to bring application-layer security directly into code. The SDK, now in beta, extends Arcjet&rsquo;s security platform to Python-based services and APIs to meet customer demand and AI-driven Python growth, said Arcjet Founder and CEO David Mytton. &ldquo;We started with the JavaScript ecosystem, because that&rsquo;s where most new applications are being built with full stack development,&rdquo; he told The New Stack. The company started...

🏷️ cloud

Cloudflare announced Friday it will acquire the Astro Technology Company team, which is responsible for the open source JavaScript web framework Astro. Astro is used by major brands like IKEA, Unilever, Visa and OpenAI to build fast, content-driven websites. The Astro team will join Cloudflare as employees. Astro itself will remain open source, to ensure its long-term growth and development, Cloudflare announced in a press release about the Astro acquisition. Search engines prioritize fast-loadi...

### [You Might Not Know This, but Your NAS Might Be a Good Docker Server](https://thenewstack.io/you-might-not-know-this-but-your-nas-might-be-a-good-docker-server/)

**Source:** The New Stack | **Author:** Jack Wallen | **Date:** 2026-01-16 18:00 | **Reading Time:** ~5 min

🏷️ docker, cloud

Recently, I procured a Zettlab AI NAS. This was mostly to be used to house a metric ton of video files that I work with, as my external drives were constantly getting full of clips that I no longer needed to work on, but didn&rsquo;t want to get rid of (you know&hellip; just in case). After deploying the NAS, I started poking around and noticed it had an app store. Curiosity got the best of me, so I decided to give the app store a look. As I expected, the usual trove of apps was to be found. How...

### [SLMs vs. LLMs: Why Smaller AI Models Win in Business](https://thenewstack.io/slms-vs-llms-why-smaller-ai-models-win-in-business/)

**Source:** The New Stack | **Author:** Sean Falconer | **Date:** 2026-01-16 17:00 | **Reading Time:** ~8 min

🏷️ reliability, deployment, pipeline, infrastructure

Enterprise AI inherited the consumer model of AI, but it&rsquo;s the wrong one for most business-to-business (B2B) problems. In the consumer world, the appeal of generative AI is its role as an omniscient polymath. A single interface can write a poem, debug code, plan a vacation and answer trivia pulled from across the public internet. This makes sense in an open world, where the range of possible questions is unbounded and success is subjective. When AI must handle anything a user might ask, sc...

### [Orchestration: The Key to Integrating AI with Legacy Systems](https://thenewstack.io/orchestration-the-key-to-integrating-ai-with-legacy-systems/)

**Source:** The New Stack | **Author:** Jakob Freund | **Date:** 2026-01-16 16:00 | **Reading Time:** ~4 min

🏷️ reliability, automation, monitoring

In today&rsquo;s enterprise landscape, AI may dominate the conversation, but legacy systems still underpin mission-critical operations for many &mdash; if not most &mdash; businesses. At the same time, organizations are investing heavily in AI to automate more. However, many of these AI capabilities end up layered on systems never designed to support them, creating a patchwork of disconnected tools. It&rsquo;s no surprise that, according to the NANDA project at MIT, only 5% of AI pilots move int...

### [Memory for AI Agents: A New Paradigm of Context Engineering](https://thenewstack.io/memory-for-ai-agents-a-new-paradigm-of-context-engineering/)

**Source:** The New Stack | **Author:** Nicole Seah | **Date:** 2026-01-16 15:00 | **Reading Time:** ~6 min

🏷️ automation, infrastructure, cloud

For today&rsquo;s AI agents, memory is a moat. Every conversation counts, but traditional large language models (LLMs) are stateless &mdash; they start each interaction without any context or memory, leaving power untapped and insight lost. Imagining new paradigms of agent memory has become one of the most urgent frontiers in AI development, allowing for active formation and updating of memories, so agents can use all past interactions in a meaningful way. There are many parallels to human memor...

**Source:** The New Stack | **Author:** Joab Jackson | **Date:** 2026-01-16 14:15 | **Reading Time:** ~3 min

🏷️ ci/cd, prometheus, observability, kubernetes, deployment

The Dragonfly project, an open source peer-to-peer image and file distribution system, has graduated from the Cloud Native Computing Foundation&lsquo;s program for incubating new cloud native technologies. The open source technology, under CNCF&rsquo;s wing since 2018, has shown that it can work in production settings, with its ability to copy containers and large AI models across a network at scale, according to the organization. Built to run on Kubernetes, it has found use by organizations man...

### [Nvidia DGX Spark: The New Stack Developer’s Guide](https://thenewstack.io/nvidia-dgx-spark-the-new-stack-developers-guide/)

**Source:** The New Stack | **Author:** Janakiram MSV | **Date:** 2026-01-16 14:00 | **Reading Time:** ~12 min

🏷️ microservices, pipeline, monitoring, infrastructure, docker

The ability to run large AI models locally defines the next frontier of developer productivity. Without desktop-class AI compute, data scientists and AI developers remain tethered to cloud infrastructure, constrained by latency, cost unpredictability and data sovereignty concerns. Nvidia DGX Spark is a &ldquo;personal AI supercomputer&rdquo; in a compact desktop form factor. With DGX Spark developers gain a self-contained AI development platform that brings data center capabilities to their desk...
