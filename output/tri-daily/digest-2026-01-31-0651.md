### [Docker Sandboxes: Run Claude Code and Other Coding Agents Unsupervised (but Safely)](https://www.docker.com/blog/docker-sandboxes-run-claude-code-and-other-coding-agents-unsupervised-but-safely/)

**Source:** Docker Blog | **Author:** Srini Sekaran | **Date:** 2026-01-30 23:39 | **Reading Time:** ~3 min

🏷️ docker, security

We introduced Docker Sandboxes in experimental preview a few months ago. Today, we’re launching the next evolution with microVM isolation, available now for macOS and Windows. We started Docker Sandboxes to answer the question: How do I run Claude Code or Gemini CLI safely? Sandboxes provide disposable, isolated environments purpose-built for coding agents. Each agent runs in an isolated version of your development environment, so when it installs packages, modifies configurations, deletes files...

### [The shift left hangover: Why modern platforms are shifting down to cure developer fatigue](https://thenewstack.io/shift-left-hangover-steve-corndell/)

**Source:** The New Stack | **Author:** Steve Corndell | **Date:** 2026-01-31 02:22 | **Reading Time:** ~5 min

🏷️ pipeline, devops, automation, cloud, kubernetes

Over the last decade, &ldquo;shift left&rdquo; became the mantra of high-performing engineering organizations. The premise was sound: Move testing, security, and compliance earlier (to the left) in the software development lifecycle (SDLC) to catch issues when they are cheapest to fix. Business leaders loved it because it promised efficiency. Security teams loved it because it promised compliance by design. Unfortunately for us, nobody asked the developers. As a CEO with a background in revenue ...

### [Anthropic brings plugins to Cowork](https://thenewstack.io/anthropic-brings-plugins-to-cowork/)

**Source:** The New Stack | **Author:** Frederic Lardinois | **Date:** 2026-01-30 18:00 | **Reading Time:** ~2 min

🏷️ github

Anthropic is extending Cowork with a plugin system that bundles skills, connectors, slash commands, and sub-agents, giving non-developers the kind of extensibility that Claude Code users are already familiar with. Cowork, which launched only two weeks ago, is Anthropic&rsquo;s version of Claude Code for knowledge workers who don&rsquo;t want to write code but want to have a similar agentic tool that helps them create or clean up documents, organize files, and summarize large numbers of locally s...

### [When AI fails: The new reality of incident management](https://thenewstack.io/when-ai-fails-the-new-reality-of-incident-management/)

**Source:** The New Stack | **Author:** Kat Gaines | **Date:** 2026-01-30 17:00 | **Reading Time:** ~4 min

🏷️ security, automation, reliability

If 2025 was the year of AI adoption, with 88% of organizations now using AI across at least one business function, 2026 is likely to be the year of the AI incident. As AI systems are deployed at speed, gaps in governance, oversight, and resilience are surfacing. In this environment, IT operations (ITOps) teams must prepare for AI incidents and rethink traditional operations management processes to reflect the changing nature of risk. In the year ahead, three shifts will define the way organizati...

### [Why the forward-deployed engineer is tech’s hottest job](https://thenewstack.io/why-the-forward-deployed-engineer-is-techs-hottest-job/)

**Source:** The New Stack | **Author:** Jennifer Riggins | **Date:** 2026-01-30 15:00 | **Reading Time:** ~10 min

🏷️ aws, deployment, cloud

Your LinkedIn is suddenly filled with posts and job ads for the forward-deployed engineer (FDE) role. What does that even mean? The term FDE was&nbsp;coined by Palantir, which provides data integration and analysis platforms for governments, including the defense industry. In the military, a forward-deployed soldier is stationed overseas, ready for rapid response. In tech, this engineer is deployed to a client, or to internal developer customers, to help them prepare for and respond to complexit...

### [Forget VMware and VirtualBox: This should be your new VM manager](https://thenewstack.io/forget-vmware-and-virtualbox-this-should-be-your-new-vm-manager/)

**Source:** The New Stack | **Author:** Jack Wallen | **Date:** 2026-01-30 15:00 | **Reading Time:** ~5 min

🏷️ reliability

For decades, I used VirtualBox for all my virtual machine (VM) needs. I could use it as a graphical user interface (GUI), or I could run it from the command line. It was easy to work with, was cross-platform, and rarely caused me any problems. Until it didn&rsquo;t. Over the past few years, I cannot tell you how many times I wound up with a broken VirtualBox installation that required me to completely remove the software and reinstall it. Generally speaking, it was a hassle, but the solution wor...

### [New Conversion from cgroup v1 CPU Shares to v2 CPU Weight](https://kubernetes.io/blog/2026/01/30/new-cgroup-v1-to-v2-cpu-conversion-formula/)

**Source:** Kubernetes Blog | **Date:** 2026-01-30 16:00 | **Reading Time:** ~4 min

🏷️ kubernetes, github, deployment, monitoring

I'm excited to announce the implementation of an improved conversion formula from cgroup v1 CPU shares to cgroup v2 CPU weight. This enhancement addresses critical issues with CPU priority allocation for Kubernetes workloads when running on systems with cgroup v2. Background Kubernetes was originally designed with cgroup v1 in mind, where CPU shares were defined simply by assigning the container's CPU requests in millicpu form. For example, a container requesting 1 CPU (1024m) would get (cpu.sha...
