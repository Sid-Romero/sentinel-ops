### [Making (Very) Small LLMs Smarter](https://www.docker.com/blog/making-small-llms-smarter/)

**Source:** Docker Blog | **Author:** Yiwen Xu | **Date:** 2026-01-16 13:47 | **Reading Time:** ~19 min

🏷️ docker, github

Hello, I’m Philippe, and I am a Principal Solutions Architect helping customers with their usage of Docker. I started getting seriously interested in generative AI about two years ago. What interests me most is the ability to run language models (LLMs) directly on my laptop (For work, I have a MacBook Pro M2 max, but on a more personal level, I run LLMs on my personal MacBook Air M4 and on Raspberry Pis &#8211; yes, it&#8217;s possible, but I&#8217;ll talk about that another time). Let&#8217;s b...

The Dragonfly project, an open source peer-to-peer image and file distribution system, has graduated from the Cloud Native Computing Foundation&lsquo;s program for incubating new cloud native technologies. The open source technology, under CNCF&rsquo;s wing since 2018, has shown that it can work in production settings, with its ability to copy containers and large AI models across a network at scale, according to the organization. Built to run on Kubernetes, it has found use by organizations man...

🏷️ infrastructure, security, microservices, cloud, docker

The ability to run large AI models locally defines the next frontier of developer productivity. Without desktop-class AI compute, data scientists and AI developers remain tethered to cloud infrastructure, constrained by latency, cost unpredictability and data sovereignty concerns. Nvidia DGX Spark is a &ldquo;personal AI supercomputer&rdquo; in a compact desktop form factor. With DGX Spark developers gain a self-contained AI development platform that brings data center capabilities to their desk...

### [The New Threats: Attackers Don’t Just Break In, They Blend In](https://thenewstack.io/the-new-threats-attackers-dont-just-break-in-they-blend-in/)

**Source:** The New Stack | **Author:** Kavi Daula | **Date:** 2026-01-15 23:00 | **Reading Time:** ~4 min

🏷️ cloud, pipeline, infrastructure, monitoring

These days, malicious actors succeed not by breaking systems, but by blending into them. Increasingly, the intruder looks like a legitimate workload. The alarm doesn&rsquo;t ring, until it&rsquo;s too late. Take, for instance, the recently identified RustyWater implant associated with the Muddy Water advanced persistent threat. After RustyWater enters a system, it persists quietly. It avoids the obvious paths for escalating the threat, and keeps its interactions to a minimum, the better to stay ...

### [Start Small and Go Big With Open Source Gonzo for Observability](https://thenewstack.io/start-small-and-go-big-with-open-source-gonzo-for-observability/)

**Source:** The New Stack | **Author:** B. Cameron Gain | **Date:** 2026-01-15 22:00 | **Reading Time:** ~4 min

🏷️ observability, github, kubernetes, cloud, deployment

Logs are essentially a language, and if you throw the right information into a large language model (LLM), it can help explain what happened. There is a hook in Gonzo where users can throw a log into their favorite LLM via backend APIs. This helps bubble up patterns such as repeated critical metrics and assists in pattern analysis and heat charts to separate the signal from the noise. As more code is created by AI, the complexity of logs is not getting simpler, necessitating a step back to look ...

🏷️ infrastructure, security, observability, automation, deployment

API sprawl hides both security dangers and missed opportunities. If an organization has more APIs than it can easily keep track of, those APIs can easily become entry points for malicious actors. And if those APIs are underutilized, they&rsquo;re not making the most of their potential to generate revenue. &ldquo;APIs run the core business process you want to scale,&rdquo; said Neeraj Nargund, who oversees the strategic partnerships for the automation brand at IBM, in this episode of The New Stac...

**Source:** The New Stack | **Author:** Richard MacManus | **Date:** 2026-01-15 15:34 | **Reading Time:** ~6 min

Tailwind has been in the news lately, as it struggles to keep its doors open in the AI era. But it&rsquo;s not the only &ldquo;CSS-in-JS&rdquo; solution to compete for developers&rsquo; attention. Recently Meta has been promoting its open source, React-based styling project, StyleX. Unlike Tailwind, it&rsquo;s not a framework &mdash; Meta calls it both a JavaScript library and, more broadly, a &ldquo;system.&rdquo; But regardless, StyleX is yet another alternative to directly using the style she...
