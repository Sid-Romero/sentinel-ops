### [Security Is a Developer Experience Problem, Rooted in Our Foundations](https://www.docker.com/blog/security-is-a-developer-experience-problem-rooted-in-our-foundations/)

**Source:** Docker Blog | **Author:** Aditya Tripathi | **Date:** 2026-01-09 16:11 | **Reading Time:** ~6 min

🏷️ security, docker, infrastructure

For more than a decade, the industry has tried to improve software security by pushing it closer to developers. We moved scanners into CI, added security checks to pull requests, and asked teams to respond faster to an ever-growing stream of vulnerabilities. And yet, the underlying problems have not gone away. The issue is not that developers care too little about security. It is that we keep trying to fix security at the edges, instead of fixing the foundations. Hardened container images change...

### [The Hidden Cost Killing Your Innovation Strategy](https://thenewstack.io/the-hidden-cost-killing-your-innovation-strategy/)

🏷️ security, infrastructure, devops, monitoring, devsecops

In today&rsquo;s AI rush, I&rsquo;ve seen even the most disciplined organizations find it nearly impossible to enforce the hard-won lessons of DevOps and DevSecOps into AI adoption. These organizations often feel forced to choose between moving fast and staying in control. As a result, they develop &mdash; almost by default &mdash; a &ldquo;wait and see&rdquo; approach to AI usage and implementation, creating a new, more dangerous form of technical debt. I call it the AI blind spot debt. It&rsqu...

### [The One Mistake That Weakens Every AI-Generated App](https://thenewstack.io/the-one-mistake-that-weakens-every-ai-generated-app/)

**Source:** The New Stack | **Author:** Oluwadamilola Oshungboye | **Date:** 2026-01-09 19:03 | **Reading Time:** ~12 min

🏷️ github, security, pipeline, infrastructure, ci/cd

If you&rsquo;ve ever built more than a quick prototype with AI tools like Lovable or Replit, you&rsquo;ve likely felt the friction that comes with extending the first version. A small code refactoring can trigger new bugs, a new feature can break old logic and progress starts to feel like rework instead of iteration. This pattern isn&rsquo;t random. Most AI coding tools are designed to generate code quickly, rather than preserving structure over time. While they can create working APIs and funct...

### [DeepSeek to Unfurl AI Model with Enhanced Coding Capabilities in February: Report](https://devops.com/deepseek-to-unfurl-ai-model-with-enhanced-coding-capabilities-in-february-report/)

**Source:** DevOps.com | **Author:** Jon Swartz | **Date:** 2026-01-09 18:39 | **Reading Time:** ~1 min

DeepSeek is preparing to launch its next-generation artificial intelligence (AI) model, V4, in mid-February, according to a report in The Information, citing two people with direct knowledge of the company&#8217;s plans. The upcoming release marks the Chinese startup’s first major model update since its R1 reasoning model in January 2025 sparked global attention and sent [&#8230;]

**Source:** The New Stack | **Author:** Carlos Rolo | **Date:** 2026-01-09 18:00 | **Reading Time:** ~6 min

🏷️ deployment, observability, infrastructure, reliability

While big models captured all the early glory with their larger context windows, greater parameters and more power, the reality on the ground for many enterprise engineering teams has gotten increasingly frustrating. Scale alone felt like it would generate intelligence, but most AI projects still feel like prototypes because the industry chased model size at the expense of the real bottleneck, retrieval. We&rsquo;ve reached the stage where enterprises need accuracy over novelty, with an AI strat...

### [Snowflake Plans $1B Acquisition of Observe to Expand AI-Powered Observability](https://devops.com/snowflake-plans-1b-acquisition-of-observe-to-expand-ai-powered-observability/)

**Source:** DevOps.com | **Author:** James Maguire | **Date:** 2026-01-09 17:49 | **Reading Time:** ~1 min

🏷️ observability, cloud

Snowflake has signed an agreement to acquire observability startup Observe, moving to fold AI-driven telemetry analysis directly into its AI Data Cloud as enterprises grapple with the operational complexity created by large-scale AI systems. Financial terms were not disclosed, though multiple reports estimate the transaction at roughly $1 billion, which would make it the largest [&#8230;]

**Source:** The New Stack | **Author:** Loraine Lawson | **Date:** 2026-01-09 17:00 | **Reading Time:** ~5 min

🏷️ helm, infrastructure, cloud

Tailwind CSS, the popular CSS framework, laid off three engineers &mdash; 75% of its engineering team &mdash; on Monday. In a personal podcast posted to the X platform on Wednesday, Tailwind creator Adam Wathan claimed that AI played a significant role in the open source project&rsquo;s declining revenues. &ldquo;I do think the percentage is important to share, because to say that, &lsquo;Oh, we have to let go three people, it doesn&rsquo;t sound like we have to do much, but in reality, we have ...

🏷️ security, observability, devops, monitoring, devsecops

In today&#8217;s rapidly developing software world, security cannot be an afterthought. DevSecOps, the integration of security practices into every phase of DevOps, requires continuous monitoring and actionable insights to detect and mitigate threats effectively. Observability plays an essential role in this ecosystem by providing deep visibility into the security posture of the development process, enabling [&#8230;]

### [From Reactive to Predictive: Capacity Planning Systems That Actually Work](https://devops.com/from-reactive-to-predictive-capacity-planning-systems-that-actually-work/)

**Source:** DevOps.com | **Author:** Muhammad Yawar Malik | **Date:** 2026-01-09 16:24 | **Reading Time:** ~1 min

🏷️ cloud

I used to think capacity planning was about setting up CloudWatch alarms and hoping they&#8217;d fire before things broke. Spoiler: that&#8217;s not capacity planning—that&#8217;s just reactive firefighting with extra steps. Real capacity planning means knowing you&#8217;ll need more database capacity three weeks from now, not three minutes after your site starts timing out. It means [&#8230;]

**Source:** DevOps.com | **Author:** Judit Sharon | **Date:** 2026-01-09 16:23 | **Reading Time:** ~1 min

🏷️ monitoring

At 2:07 a.m., a core production node went down. CPU usage spiked, latency ballooned and requests started timing out across the cluster. Monitoring tools caught it instantly as dashboards glowed red, alert rules fired and incident payloads were dutifully sent downstream. Everything functioned exactly as designed. Except no one responded. The alert reached every configured [&#8230;]

**Source:** The New Stack | **Author:** Jack Wallen | **Date:** 2026-01-09 16:00 | **Reading Time:** ~4 min

🏷️ gitlab, docker

Do you have too many Docker containers running? A quick check of my home lab and on just a single server, I have 10 running Docker containers. How do I manage them, let alone just keep track of what&rsquo;s what? I could deploy Portainer, but that&rsquo;s overkill at this point. Besides, Portainer is more an enterprise app now, so using it on a home lab, a development environment, or a small business just isn&rsquo;t really all that practical. That&rsquo;s where an app like Dockhand comes into p...

🏷️ security, cloud, kubernetes

Database support provider Percona is donating a database management tool for Kubernetes environments to the Cloud Native Computing Foundation (CNCF). For Kubernetes environs, the newly named OpenEverest (formerly called Percona Everest) provides a unified interface for managing different types of databases, including provisioning and management. Thus far, it supports PostgreSQL, MySQL and MongoDB. The company&rsquo;s strategy is to make OpenEverest a multivendor project managed by open governanc...

🏷️ security, automation, infrastructure, terraform, deployment

Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE) Agent Sandbox is a new Kubernetes extension designed to run workloads, such as AI agents, that execute untrusted or specialized code in isolated, secure environments. In essence, it provides a lightweight &ldquo;VM-like&rdquo; sandbox within a Kubernetes cluster, leveraging technologies such as gVisor to achieve strong kernel-level isolation. This deep dive will explore what GKE Sandbox for Agents is, its role in the GKE ecosystem, and the architectural components ...
