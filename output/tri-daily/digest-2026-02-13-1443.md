### [How to solve the context size issues with context packing with Docker Model Runner and Agentic Compose](https://www.docker.com/blog/context-packing-context-window/)

**Source:** Docker Blog | **Author:** Yiwen Xu | **Date:** 2026-02-13 13:57 | **Reading Time:** ~8 min

🏷️ helm, docker

If you’ve worked with local language models, you’ve probably run into the context window limit, especially when using smaller models on less powerful machines. While it’s an unavoidable constraint, techniques like context packing make it surprisingly manageable. Hello, I’m Philippe, and I am a Principal Solutions Architect helping customers with their usage of Docker. In my previous blog post, I wrote about how to make a very small model useful by using RAG. I had limited the message history to ...

### [Securing modern workloads with HashiCorp Vault and WIF](https://www.hashicorp.com/blog/securing-modern-workloads-with-hashicorp-vault-and-wif)

**Source:** HashiCorp Blog | **Author:** Nesh Chandarana | **Date:** 2026-02-12 17:00 | **Reading Time:** ~4 min

🏷️ devops, azure, security, kubernetes, github

Modern enterprises are increasingly cloud-native, running workloads across multiple clouds, Kubernetes clusters, and CI/CD pipelines. For CIOs, CISOs, and technical managers, the challenge is clear: traditional static credentials and perimeter-based security are no longer enough. HashiCorp Vault, combined with workload identity federation (WIF), allows organizations to enforce zero trust principles while reducing risk, improving auditability, and streamlining operations. The risk of static crede...

### [Why 40% of AI projects will be canceled by 2027 (and how to stay in the other 60%)](https://thenewstack.io/agentic-ai-connectivity-platform/)

**Source:** The New Stack | **Author:** Alex Drag | **Date:** 2026-02-13 14:00 | **Reading Time:** ~8 min

🏷️ observability, security, deployment, infrastructure

The agentic AI race is on, and most organizations are at risk of losing it. Not because they lack ambition, but because they&rsquo;re fighting three wars simultaneously without a unified strategy. Looking at what separates successful agentic AI programs from the 40% that Gartner predicts will be canceled by 2027, the pattern is clear. Organizations aren&rsquo;t failing at AI. They&rsquo;re failing at the infrastructure that makes AI work at enterprise scale. There are three underlying crises of ...

**Source:** The New Stack | **Author:** Todd R. Weiss | **Date:** 2026-02-13 13:00 | **Reading Time:** ~6 min

🏷️ security, helm

AI agents are all the rage in enterprises today. CEOs and CTOs want them brought into their businesses ASAP to perform a wide range of tasks that can streamline operations while boosting sales, revenue, and productivity. But building and deploying effective and laser-focused AI agents takes more than desire. It requires an enormous and reliable firehose of critical business data that provides the lifeblood for effective agentic AI development and use inside enterprises. Building and operating AI...

**Source:** The New Stack | **Author:** Nick Lucchesi | **Date:** 2026-02-13 00:11 | **Reading Time:** ~2 min

🏷️ observability, security

Dynatrace is experiencing a major moment in its history. It&rsquo;s expanding from an observability platform what might be described as a new environment, one that offers configurations for autonomous operations and security. In this episode of The New Stack Makers, Alois Reitbauer, Chief Technology Strategist at Dynatrace, unpacks his predictions for a world where agentic AI manages production environments. This interview, recorded at the Dynatrace Perform conference in late January, took place...

🏷️ github

The latest iteration of the TIOBE Index of programming languages indicates that more specialized languages are creeping up on Python&rsquo;s dominance. Although Python remains the most popular programming language, the index suggests that several more specialized languages are gradually gaining ground at Python&rsquo;s expense, most notably R and Perl. Python has maintained a lead of more than 10 percentage points over its closest competitors. In absolute terms, Python reached its peak popularit...

🏷️ security

Software teams have always lived with a built-in tension – developers push to ship fast, while security teams pump the brakes to assess risk. Now, with AI flooding the enterprise, that friction is spiking. One recent survey found a staggering 322% jump in privilege-escalation risks tied to AI-generated code. The root problem isn’t new – [&#8230;]

### [Your RAG System is probably image-blind, but it doesn’t have to be](https://thenewstack.io/multimodal-rag-hybrid-search/)

**Source:** The New Stack | **Author:** Tushar Madaan | **Date:** 2026-02-12 20:00 | **Reading Time:** ~6 min

🏷️ deployment, cloud, pipeline, kubernetes

In the race to deploy generative AI, most enterprises have mastered &ldquo;text RAG&rdquo; to chat with PDFs and spreadsheets. However, enterprise data is rarely just text. It is a complex tapestry of technical manuals with diagrams, insurance claims with damage photos, medical records with X-rays, and product catalogs with high-resolution imagery. To unlock the true value of these assets, businesses must move beyond text-only RAG. The next frontier is multimodal RAG with hybrid search. The busi...

🏷️ security, cloud, github

With its Visual Studio Code (VS Code) January 2026 release (v1.109), Microsoft is making the code editor &ldquo;the home for multi-agent development,&rdquo; introducing support for Anthropic Claude and&nbsp;OpenAI Codex agents, as well as an updated session management system that lets developers orchestrate multiple AI assistants from a single interface. This shifts developers from a single-agent workflow to a multi-agent paradigm, allowing them to run GitHub Copilot, Claude, and Codex side by s...

### [OpenAI’s new Codex Spark model is built for speed](https://thenewstack.io/openais-new-codex-spark-is-optimized-for-speed/)

**Source:** The New Stack | **Author:** Frederic Lardinois | **Date:** 2026-02-12 18:00 | **Reading Time:** ~4 min

🏷️ pipeline

OpenAI&rsquo;s new GPT-5.3-Codex-Spark model is a bit of a departure for the company&rsquo;s family of Codex software development models: its focus is squarely on reducing latency. Powered by Cerebras&rsquo; 125-petaflop Wafer Scale Engine 3, the Codex Spark model is meant for use cases where latency matters as much &mdash; or more &mdash; than intelligence. And fast it is: Codex Spark can deliver more than 1,000 tokens per second. When OpenAI launched GPT-5.3-Codex only a few days ago, it highl...

### [The hidden reason database debt is ten times harder to fix than code](https://thenewstack.io/managing-database-debt/)

**Source:** The New Stack | **Author:** Wen Jie Teo | **Date:** 2026-02-12 15:00 | **Reading Time:** ~6 min

🏷️ pipeline, monitoring

Technical debt is an inevitable byproduct of software development as complexity grows. However, unlike stateless application code, the stateful nature of databases makes this debt far easier to accumulate and significantly harder to pay off, sometimes taking weeks and even months of planning and execution. Existing data creates massive inertia against change, and having different sets of data in different environments, from development to production, makes problems hard to predict. Add in the pa...
