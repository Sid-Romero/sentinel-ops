### [This simple infrastructure gap is holding back AI productivity](https://thenewstack.io/this-simple-infrastructure-gap-is-holding-back-ai-productivity/)

🏷️ observability, security, deployment, pipeline, infrastructure

Organizations are investing heavily in AI, with some allocating up to 8% of their total revenue in AI tools for internal productivity. Yet, the 2025 AI at Work report found that only 1% of companies consider themselves &ldquo;mature&rdquo; in terms of AI deployment. This is an uncomfortable contradiction. The DORA Impact of Generative AI in Software Development report found that as AI adoption increased, delivery throughput declined by 1.5% and stability declined by 7.2%. Code is being written f...

### [Wasm vs. JavaScript: Who wins at a million rows?](https://thenewstack.io/wasm-vs-javascript-who-wins-at-a-million-rows/)

**Source:** The New Stack | **Author:** Jessica Wachtel | **Date:** 2026-02-22 14:00 | **Reading Time:** ~4 min

By now it&rsquo;s pretty clear that JavaScript needs WebAssembly (Wasm) to perform heavy computational tasks. In the past few weeks we&rsquo;ve covered the basics, did a side-by-side image processing comparison, and saw the benefits of using Wasm with web workers. In this next tutorial, let&rsquo;s apply the same principle to real-world data using large CSV files.
