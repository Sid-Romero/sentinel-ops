We’re excited to announce that the Cloud Native Computing Foundation (CNCF) community has reached an important milestone: more than 300,000 contributors have participated in CNCF hosted projects across thousands of organizations from 190 countries. This incredible metric reflects the collective efforts of those who contribute code, documentation, reviews, testing, issue triage, design, and community support across the CNCF project landscape. It also represents continued participation across proj...

### [The risks of cybersecurity tool sprawl: Why consolidation is a strategic priority](https://www.hashicorp.com/blog/the-risks-of-cybersecurity-tool-sprawl-and-why-we-need-consolidation)

**Source:** HashiCorp Blog | **Author:** Mitch Pronschinske | **Date:** 2026-01-12 23:00 | **Reading Time:** ~4 min

🏷️ security, infrastructure, cloud

New threats emerge every week, and many vendors respond with narrow, new reactive cybersecurity tool purchases to make sure a specific incident never happens again. The result? Tool sprawl. Some organizations now rely on anywhere from 45 to 83 separate cybersecurity tools. This fragmented approach drives up costs, complicates workflows, and (believe it or not) actually increases risk and makes you less secure due to poor integration and limited visibility. Business leaders are taking notice: Wha...

### [How to start consolidating your cybersecurity tools](https://www.hashicorp.com/blog/how-to-start-consolidating-your-cybersecurity-tools)

**Source:** HashiCorp Blog | **Author:** Mitch Pronschinske | **Date:** 2026-01-12 23:00 | **Reading Time:** ~5 min

🏷️ cloud, infrastructure, ci/cd, observability, security

In part 1 of this two-part blog series, we looked at why cybersecurity tool sprawl has become a critical risk and cost issue for modern enterprises. From overlapping functionality and alert fatigue, to slower incident response and increased maintenance burden, the downsides of fragmented tooling are clear and growing. Now, we move from why to how. If your organization is ready to simplify, reduce risk, and improve efficiency, this practical guide outlines the first steps toward a more unified, s...

### [Hybrid cloud, explained: What it is, what it isn’t, and why having a plan matters in 2026](https://www.hashicorp.com/blog/hybrid-cloud-explained-what-it-is-what-it-isn-t-and-why-having-a-plan-matters)

**Source:** HashiCorp Blog | **Author:** Jenny Evans | **Date:** 2026-01-12 17:00 | **Reading Time:** ~4 min

🏷️ cloud, reliability, infrastructure, security, automation

The mandate to leverage data and AI for operational gain is forcing businesses to reckon with growing complexity in their IT infrastructure. As a result, leaders are now asking: What is hybrid cloud, and what role will it play in our company’s future? Increasingly, companies rely on a mix of public and private cloud infrastructure services, as well as systems they own and operate themselves. Done right, this hybrid architecture lets organizations connect on-premises solutions that still support ...

### [The AI Verification Bottleneck: Developer Toil Isn’t Shrinking](https://thenewstack.io/the-ai-verification-bottleneck-developer-toil-isnt-shrinking/)

**Source:** The New Stack | **Author:** Anirban Chatterjee | **Date:** 2026-01-12 22:00 | **Reading Time:** ~5 min

🏷️ reliability, security

The first few years of generative AI in software development felt like a series of increasingly impressive magic tricks. We asked complex questions and seemingly perfect code appeared in an instant. That wide-eyed wonder and early success has morphed into an industry standard: 72% of developers who have tried AI coding tools now use them every day, according to Sonar&rsquo;s latest &ldquo;State of Code Developer Survey&rdquo; report. AI is no longer a tool for side projects; it is a primary driv...

🏷️ infrastructure, github, deployment, aws, security

If you ship AI applications, you have probably noticed that the questions are changing. Enterprise security questionnaires now include AI-specific sections. Requests for proposals (RFPs) require model cards and evaluation reports that didn&rsquo;t exist six months ago. Procurement teams expect documentation about system behavior and evidence that you have actually tested the system behavior. Federal large language model (LLM) procurement requirements will land in March, and EU high-risk AI oblig...

**Source:** The New Stack | **Author:** Charles Humble | **Date:** 2026-01-12 20:00 | **Reading Time:** ~8 min

🏷️ security, github

For over 15 years, Kin Lane, co-founder and chief community officer (CCO) for open source API foundation Naftiko, has been building his expertise in APIs &mdash; not only the technical details but also the business angle. He believes that the growing use of copilots and agentic AI systems in enterprises means we must design and build APIs around business capabilities rather than resources. APIs should represent core business functions like &ldquo;manage inventory&rdquo; or &rdquo;process payment...

**Source:** The New Stack | **Author:** Pradeep Kalluri | **Date:** 2026-01-12 19:00 | **Reading Time:** ~5 min

🏷️ pipeline, monitoring

It was Monday morning when our analytics team started noticing something wrong. Customer transaction volumes had apparently skyrocketed over the weekend, up 4,700% according to the dashboards. Impossible numbers were everywhere. Our fraud detection system was flagging thousands of suspicious patterns. The executive team was already asking questions. I pulled up the logs with a sinking feeling. Sure enough, our production data pipeline had processed Saturday&rsquo;s&nbsp;data not once, not twice,...

### [Forks, Clouds and the New Economics of Open Source Licensing](https://thenewstack.io/forks-clouds-and-the-new-economics-of-open-source-licensing/)

**Source:** The New Stack | **Author:** Tobie Morgan Hitchcock | **Date:** 2026-01-12 18:49 | **Reading Time:** ~9 min

🏷️ cloud, terraform, reliability, azure, aws

When HashiCorp changed the licenses of Terraform and many of its other products from open source MPL 2.0 to the Business Source License (BSL), the backlash was intense. So intense that the community forked Terraform to create OpenTofu under a fully open source license. OpenTofu continues to gain ground, and HashiCorp (part of IBM since February 2024) has shown signs of stabilization, but the echoes of resistance still ring through the technology industry today. What this, and other high-profile ...

### [How To Use LLMs for Continuous, Creative Code Refactoring](https://thenewstack.io/how-to-use-llms-for-continuous-creative-code-refactoring/)

**Source:** The New Stack | **Author:** Jon Udell | **Date:** 2026-01-12 18:00 | **Reading Time:** ~6 min

🏷️ aws, cloud

Refactoring used to be limited to a fixed set of transforms hardwired into IDEs. If the one you needed wasn&rsquo;t included, you were out of luck and had to do it the hard way. AI-assisted IDEs with Model Context Protocol (MCP) tool support have changed that game. Show them before and after examples of a wide variety of patterns, and they can figure out all kinds of transforms without explicit support for them. For example, here is a prompt I&rsquo;m using to clean up XMLUI apps that make unnec...

### [How To Scale GitOps Without Hitting the ‘Argo Ceiling’](https://thenewstack.io/how-to-scale-gitops-without-hitting-the-argo-ceiling/)

**Source:** The New Stack | **Author:** Vicki Walker | **Date:** 2026-01-12 17:00 | **Reading Time:** ~2 min

🏷️ pipeline, devops, ci/cd, kubernetes, security

Too often, GitOps becomes a victim of its own success. One cluster and one Argo CD instance quickly sprawl into 50 clusters and 50 Argo instances, held together by glue code and custom scripts. The isolation that made Argo CD secure in the first place translates into poor visibility and uncontrolled governance. Broken processes require your team to maintain custom dashboards and brittle orchestration scripts, wasting precious engineering hours that could be spent on more important projects. What...

### [New Mobile SDK Brings Low-Code Development to On-Device AI](https://thenewstack.io/datasapiens-sdk-the-low-code-way-to-build-on-device-ai/)

**Source:** The New Stack | **Author:** Richard MacManus | **Date:** 2026-01-12 14:00 | **Reading Time:** ~6 min

One of the big AI development trends of last year was the shift to on-device inference, in many cases using so-called small language models (SLMs). Google is leading the charge on this, with its &ldquo;Web AI&rdquo; initiative and technology such as LiteRT.js, its Web AI runtime. But this trend toward processing inference on the user&rsquo;s device isn&rsquo;t just browser-based. Last month, a company called DataSapien launched a software development kit (SDK) for mobile development of on-device...
