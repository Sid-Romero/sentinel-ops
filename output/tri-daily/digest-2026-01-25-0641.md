### [Making the Most of Your Docker Hardened Images Enterprise Trial – Part 2](https://www.docker.com/blog/making-the-most-of-your-docker-hardened-images-enterprise-trial-part-2/)

🏷️ docker, infrastructure, github, ci/cd, security

Verifying Security and Compliance of Docker Hardened Images In Part 1 of this series, we migrated a Node.js service to Docker Hardened Images (DHI) and measured impressive results: 100% vulnerability elimination, 90% package reduction, and 41.5% size decrease. We extracted the SBOM and saw compliance labels for FIPS, STIG, and CIS. The numbers look compelling. But how do you verify these claims independently? Security tools earn trust through verification, not promises. When evaluating a securit...

### [Port of Context: The open source code mode](https://thenewstack.io/port-of-context-the-open-source-code-mode/)

**Source:** The New Stack | **Author:** Bill Doerrfeld | **Date:** 2026-01-24 19:00 | **Reading Time:** ~6 min

🏷️ github, automation, cloud, deployment, helm

The Model Context Protocol (MCP) has quickly become a well-adopted standard for connecting large language model (LLM)-based AI agents with external data and tools. As a result, many developers are stacking their environments with MCP tools. Seventy percent of MCP consumers have two to seven MCP servers configured, according to a late-2025 study by Zuplo. But every MCP added consumes memory, which is thinning as context windows must store chat histories and configuration files, while agents chain...

### [LLMs create a new blind spot in observability](https://thenewstack.io/llms-create-a-new-blind-spot-in-observability/)

**Source:** The New Stack | **Author:** Shahar Azulay | **Date:** 2026-01-24 18:00 | **Reading Time:** ~5 min

🏷️ infrastructure, reliability, microservices, cloud, observability

Teams that have run Software as a Service (SaaS) products know the routine: An alert goes off, and everyone scrambles to the observability stack first. Metrics, logs, and traces have been the signals that help engineers figure out what broke, why users are stuck or where a service-level agreement (SLA) may have slipped. And for years, these tools have worked well enough. But then AI showed up. Behind all the hype and potential surrounding copilots, chat interfaces, and intelligent assistants, en...

### [Distributed apps platform Aspire supports JavaScript, Python](https://thenewstack.io/distributed-apps-platform-aspire-supports-javascript-python/)

**Source:** The New Stack | **Author:** Loraine Lawson | **Date:** 2026-01-24 17:00 | **Reading Time:** ~3 min

🏷️ docker, cloud, kubernetes, microservices

Aspire, Microsoft&rsquo;s open source, cloud native development platform, now supports JavaScript, TypeScript, Python, and Java as first-class citizens. &ldquo;With Aspire 13, JavaScript and TypeScript developers get to join the party &mdash; and I&rsquo;m not talking about some half-baked afterthought integration,&rdquo; wrote Microsoft Senior Software Engineer David Pine on Microsoft&rsquo;s developer blog. &ldquo;This is first-class, full-featured support for orchestrating your JavaScript app...

### [How Claude Cowork helps developers spread the AI knowledge](https://thenewstack.io/how-claude-cowork-helps-developers-spread-the-ai-knowledge/)

**Source:** The New Stack | **Author:** David Eastman | **Date:** 2026-01-24 16:00 | **Reading Time:** ~5 min

Last month, I reviewed Claude Desktop and noted that the simple addition of giving Model Context Protocol (MCP) permission to use one of your local folders was a strong idea in itself. Anthropic clearly came to the same conclusion, and with agile business speed, it was able to productise this observation quickly with the release of Claude Cowork. At the moment, this is &ldquo;available as a research preview for Pro and Max plan subscribers using the Claude Desktop app on macOS.&rdquo; But more o...
