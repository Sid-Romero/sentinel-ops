### [Hardened Images Are Free. Now What?](https://www.docker.com/blog/hardened-images-free-now-what/)

🏷️ deployment, automation, monitoring, security, pipeline

Docker Hardened Images are now free, covering Alpine, Debian, and over 1,000 images including databases, runtimes, and message buses. For security teams, this changes the economics of container vulnerability management. DHI includes security fixes from Docker’s security team, which simplifies security response. Platform teams can pull the patched base image and redeploy quickly. But free hardened images raise a question: how should this change your security practice? Here’s how our thinking is e...

&quot;Developers always take easy path. So if you make the easiest way the right way, then you have the right outcome.”— Suneer Pallitharammal Mukkolakal, Lead Platform Engineer, World Bank That’s the philosophy that drove the World Bank's platform engineering transformation as they went from 5-day infrastructure provisioning timelines filled with manual processes and configuration drift, to a 30-minute self-service platform that manages 27,000 cloud resources and supports 1,700 applications acr...

### [62% of enterprises now use Java to power AI apps](https://thenewstack.io/2026-java-ai-apps/)

**Source:** The New Stack | **Author:** Darryl K. Taft | **Date:** 2026-02-10 20:58 | **Reading Time:** ~3 min

🏷️ cloud, observability, infrastructure, security

According to a new report released today, an increasing number of enterprises are using Java as a foundational language for AI development. Java platform provider Azul&rsquo;s 2026 State of Java Survey &amp; Report shows that 62% of organizations polled now use Java to code AI functionality &mdash; up from 50% last year. Java for scale This reflects a shift toward integrating machine learning models with existing Java applications. Moreover, as enterprises move AI from experimentation to product...

🏷️ devops

CodeRabbit today made available in beta a planning tool that enables DevOps teams to determine which artificial intelligence (AI) prompts to create and review before embedding them within their workflows. David Loker, vice president of AI for CodeRabbit, said CodeRabbit Issue Planner will enable DevOps teams to collaboratively apply AI to workflows versus relying on [&#8230;]

### [The hunt for truly zero-CVE container images](https://thenewstack.io/chainguard-and-the-hunt-for-truly-zero-cve-container-images/)

**Source:** The New Stack | **Author:** Steven J. Vaughan-Nichols | **Date:** 2026-02-10 19:30 | **Reading Time:** ~7 min

🏷️ docker, cloud, deployment, security

Vendors chasing &ldquo;zero-CVE&rdquo; container images on top of traditional Linux distributions are running into structural limits in upstream release models. CVEs remain a useful, but imperfect metric, for measuring safety.&nbsp; We all want zero Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVEs) in our container images, and creating such images has become a business in itself. What started as an aggressive &ldquo;shift&#8209;left&rdquo; posture has become a baseline expectation for containerized wo...

🏷️ deployment, monitoring, observability, security, kubernetes

The Extended Berkeley Packet Filter (eBPF)&nbsp; has continued on an adoption path that extends its integral role in observability, security, and networking functionality from the kernel to wherever applications and environments are deployed. Since its creation, it has served as a par excellence way to distribute code directly from the kernel and through a sandbox throughout the network. It enables the gathering of information and interaction with code and applications on the network, essentiall...

### [GitHub’s former CEO launches a developer platform for the age of agentic coding](https://thenewstack.io/thomas-dohmke-interview-entire/)

🏷️ deployment, github

When GitHub CEO Thomas Dohmke left the Microsoft-owned company in August of 2025, he said he did so to return to his startup roots. Now, after a few months of development, he is launching Entire, a new open-source developer platform that reimagines what collaboration between developers and agents could look like if built from scratch. Entire is backed by a $60 million seed round, the largest in developer tools history, led by Felicis, with participation from Madrona, Basis Set, and M12, Microsof...

🏷️ pipeline, automation, gitlab, security

AI coding assistants are making developers more productive at writing code. But why aren&rsquo;t most enterprises actually delivering more software? That&rsquo;s the question Bill Staples, who took over as CEO of GitLab just over a year ago, says he keeps hearing from customers. &ldquo;They would say: we&rsquo;ve invested. We&rsquo;re using these coding tools. Our engineers love them, but we&rsquo;re not seeing an acceleration in our innovation velocity,&rdquo; Staples says he hears when he talk...

### [TiDB and the rise of the AI-native database](https://thenewstack.io/tidb-and-the-rise-of-the-ai-native-database/)

🏷️ cloud, pipeline, infrastructure

When enterprises talk about artificial intelligence, the attention usually points to models: larger parameters, faster inference, cheaper tokens. But we at TiDB contend that this framing misses the most consequential change now underway in this sector. In the AI era, data infrastructure &mdash; not AI models &mdash; will define the new competitive advantage. This parallels the development of databases themselves, which are undergoing their own fundamental transformation. That belief is shaping t...

A global survey of 2,039 Java developers published today finds 63% reporting that dead and unused code adversely affects their team’s productivity, with 22% describing the impact of that technical debt as being severe. Conducted by Dimensional Research on behalf of Azul, a provider of a distribution of OpenJDK, the survey also finds that more [&#8230;]

🏷️ automation

The vibe coding guy is back, and this time he&rsquo;s talking about &ldquo;agentic engineering.&rdquo; Andrej Karpathy, who last year this time popularized the term &ldquo;vibe coding,&rdquo; now says that LLMs have gotten much smarter, such that vibe coding is now pass&eacute;. &ldquo;Today (1 year later), programming via LLM agents is increasingly becoming a default workflow for professionals, except with more oversight and scrutiny,&rdquo; Karpathy writes in a post he shared last week on X. &...
