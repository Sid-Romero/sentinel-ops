🏷️ automation, monitoring, reliability, ci/cd, cloud

The promise of DevOps and Platform Engineering is to balance developer velocity with enterprise governance. In 2026, AI Agents move from being simple assistance tools to the core mechanisms that automate this balance. Recent publications, such as the CNCF 2025 Technology Radar report, highlight growing experimentation with agentic AI standards (for example, MCP). As we begin 2026, it’s time to forecast how the enterprise shift to autonomy will be defined by four distinct, AI-driven control mecha...

### [How to Automate Arm Migration with Docker MCP Toolkit, VS Code, and GitHub Copilot](https://www.docker.com/blog/automate-arm-migration-docker-mcp-copilot/)

**Source:** Docker Blog | **Author:** Jennifer Kohl | **Date:** 2026-01-23 14:00 | **Reading Time:** ~16 min

🏷️ azure, cloud, github, aws, docker

This post is a collaboration between Docker and Arm, demonstrating how Docker MCP Toolkit and the Arm MCP Server work together to simplify architecture migrations. Moving workloads from x86 to ARM64 architecture has become increasingly important. Organizations seek to reduce cloud costs and improve performance. AWS Graviton, Azure Cobalt, and Google Cloud Axion have made Arm-based computing mainstream, promising 20-40% cost savings and better performance for many workloads. But here&#8217;s the ...

### [Using MCP Servers: From Quick Tools to Multi-Agent Systems](https://www.docker.com/blog/mcp-servers-docker-toolkit-cagent-gateway/)

**Source:** Docker Blog | **Author:** Yiwen Xu | **Date:** 2026-01-22 19:35 | **Reading Time:** ~6 min

🏷️ docker, github, cloud

Model Context Protocol (MCP) servers are a spec for exposing tools, models, or services to language models through a common interface. Think of them as smart adapters: they sit between a tool and the LLM, speaking a predictable protocol that lets the model interact with things like APIs, databases, and agents without needing to know implementation details. But like most good ideas, the devil’s in the details. The Promise—and the Problems of Running MCP Servers Running an MCP sounds simple: spin ...

Enterprises in highly regulated industries spent 2025 rigorously evaluating AI capabilities, conducting proofs of concepts, and distinguishing genuine value from market noise. Through systematic testing and measurement, they&rsquo;ve identified specific use cases where AI generates measurable outcomes while meeting stringent compliance standards. This year marks a decisive pivot toward large-scale AI implementation that will fundamentally alter the way these industries operate and serve stakehol...

🏷️ docker, deployment, monitoring

One of the more challenging aspects of using Docker containers is troubleshooting. Unless you are a master of the art, just the mere act of finding out where to begin your troubleshooting journey can be a hair-pulling adventure. Sure, you can troubleshoot from the command line, but when you&rsquo;re dealing with a metric ton of containers, that&rsquo;s just not practical. After all, you don&rsquo;t want to wind up working 24/7, do you? I didn&rsquo;t think so. With that in mind, what can you do ...

On a surface level, AI agents aren&rsquo;t so different from microservices, according to Chris Aniszczyk, co-founder and CTO of the Cloud Native Computing Foundation (CNCF). The New Stack spoke with Aniszczyk about the AI and CNCF programs ahead of this year&rsquo;s KubeCon + CloudNativeCon Europe, set for March 23-26 in Amsterdam. &ldquo;If you think about what an agent is at a surface level, it sounds like a microservice,&rdquo; Aniszczyk tells The New Stack during this week&rsquo;s episode of...

🏷️ helm, reliability, pipeline

As AI coding assistants become more capable, the relationship between developers and their tools is evolving beyond a simple autocomplete. AI won&rsquo;t replace developers, but we need to rethink the way developers work with AI to maximize speed and quality. One highly effective approach is what I call the &ldquo;head chef&rdquo; model. Much like a head chef doesn&rsquo;t chop every vegetable or stir every pot, developers will no longer be writing most of their own code. Instead, they&rsquo;ll ...

**Source:** The New Stack | **Author:** Ibrahim Kamal | **Date:** 2026-01-22 18:00 | **Reading Time:** ~10 min

🏷️ pipeline, monitoring, observability, deployment, reliability

In the past few years, agentic AI systems like AutoGPT, BabyAGI and others have demonstrated, through prompting, that large language models (LLMs) can accomplish a wide range of tasks, including planning, reasoning and executing multistep processes with little human involvement. They have shown that LLMs can do far more than simply answer individual questions and are capable of taking on more comprehensive autonomous problem-solving. The appeal has been both rapid and intense. Agentic systems pr...

🏷️ security, github, cloud

Late last week, the global cloud platform Cloudflare acquired the company behind Astro, one of the leading frontend frameworks. This follows a pattern of popular frameworks coming under the umbrella of platform companies &mdash; or at least becoming financially supported by them. This trend perhaps began in 2021, when Vercel hired Svelte creator Rich Harris. That same year, WordPress vendor Automattic acquired a React framework company called Frontity. In 2022, the global e-commerce company Shop...
