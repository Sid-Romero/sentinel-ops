We’re excited to share a seamless new integration between Docker Model Runner (DMR) and Open WebUI, bringing together two open source projects to make working with self-hosted models easier than ever. With this update, Open WebUI automatically detects and connects to Docker Model Runner running at localhost:12434. If Docker Model Runner is enabled, Open WebUI uses it out of the box, no additional configuration required. The result: a fully Docker-managed, self-hosted model experience running in ...

### [Secure remote access without the ‘portal tax’: Boundary vs other vendors](https://www.hashicorp.com/blog/secure-remote-access-without-the-portal-tax-boundary-vs-other-vendors)

🏷️ security

Secure remote access today is tedious. Most VPN and privileged access management (PAM) tools are a huge burden because they force users — especially engineers — to change how they work. The remote access landscape is cluttered with proprietary clients and web-based proxies. If a developer wants to SSH into a production server or access a database, they usually have to: Stop their actual work Launch a VPN Log in to a web portal Search for a &quot;safe&quot;/target account (with many of the incumb...

🏷️ cloud, security, docker

If you&rsquo;re familiar with building web applications in the last few years, you&rsquo;ve probably heard of WebAssembly (Wasm). And if not, you&rsquo;ll leave this article with a full understanding of this leading technology. Wasm is a binary instruction format that works alongside JavaScript. It speeds up web applications that process a high amount of data (i.e. image processing, heavy math computations, etc.). Think of it this way, if the purpose of the site is something that would be better...

Or at least that&rsquo;s the argument VAST Data is making this week at its first VAST Forward user conference here in Salt Lake City. The company may not be a household name yet, but it has quietly grown into one of the fastest-scaling players in data and AI infrastructure. Its more than 700 customers include some of the best-known hosting services, frontier AI labs, unicorn startups, and ne...

🏷️ aws, infrastructure

Companies actively investing in open source are seeing massive returns, while those treating it as &ldquo;freeware&rdquo; are drowning in technical debt. Here is the tech industry&rsquo;s ugly little secret: Companies make billions from open source while spending peanuts to support it. A new report from the Linux Foundation, ROI for Open Source Software Contribution, reveals that organizations giving back to their core projects realize a staggering 2x to 5x return on their investment across code...

Eric Tschetter, chief architect at Imply and creator of Apache Druid, explains how the rapid adoption of open source OpenTelemetry for instrumenting applications is reshaping modern observability architectures.

Software engineering leaders have invested heavily in generative AI coding assistants for over two years—and for good reason. For many teams, the productivity gains appear significant.

🏷️ cloud, automation, helm, infrastructure

In the past, we judged enterprise databases by how useful they were to people like us. We rated them on how well they helped architects create schemas, DBAs plan capacity, and analysts build queries. We expected databases to last a long time &mdash; years, probably &mdash; powering sales reports and quarterly projections, growing with the organization. &ldquo;But now comes a new kind of user: the AI agent. It has different needs. It operates at a different pace. It uses databases to do its work....
