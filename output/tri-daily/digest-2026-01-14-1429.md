GEICO is a juggernaut in the US insurance industry, with an IT infrastructure team that has profoundly transformed its digital architecture over the past decade. Here’s a snapshot: 2013: 100% on-premises, the CIO decides to go all-in on public cloud 2020: 80% public cloud, distributed across 8 clouds, applications still have to use databases with a client-server model that's “calling back to the closet of IT in the back room” 2022: Cost structure is 3x higher with 200K cores of compute, 30K+ VMs...

🏷️ reliability, deployment, pipeline, security

AI leaders have, for the last couple of years, obsessed over benchmarks, debating whether GPT-4, Claude or Gemini holds the crown. This enterprise AI conversation has been dominated by a single metric: Model performance. But this fixation on raw &ldquo;intelligence&rdquo; overlooks the most critical factor in successful deployment. As these models converge in capability, the battleground is shifting. The differentiator for the next generation of enterprise applications won&rsquo;t be the model i...

🏷️ cloud, devops, infrastructure

A recent survey shows that, last year, 57% of enterprise organizations spent over $1 million on migration projects &mdash; with an average loss of $315,000 per project due to unexpected overruns &mdash; in pursuit of what Anuj Kapur, CEO of CloudBees, calls &ldquo;the migration mirage.&rdquo; In this episode of The New Stack Makers, Kapur sat down with TNS Founder and Publisher Alex Williams to discuss the findings from the CloudBees &ldquo;2025 DevOps Migration Index&rdquo; report.

🏷️ kubernetes, cloud, automation, security, infrastructure

If you are responsible for a developer platform, you are probably trying to reduce cloud sprawl, speed up delivery and remove friction from DevOps workflows. Yet many internal developer platforms still fail quietly. They become hard to secure, painful to audit and impossible to scale without adding more humans to the process. The surprising part is that these failures rarely come from bad tooling choices or weak Infrastructure as Code practices. They usually come from something more basic: the a...

🏷️ cloud, deployment, aws, azure

One of the more meaningful consequences of AI&rsquo;s growth in the enterprise is its impact on the cloud race. The industry is shifting from the consolidation of services in the three main hyperscalers &mdash; AWS, Google Cloud and Microsoft Azure &mdash; to a new model in which specialization, not centralization, is the top priority. Neoclouds, with their hyperspecialized workloads for statistical AI, are driving this growing movement. Cloud providers such as CoreWeave, Lambda and Crusoe deliv...

🏷️ automation, deployment, security, infrastructure, reliability

In 2023, a Chevrolet dealership in California woke up to a viral nightmare: Its new AI chatbot had just agreed to sell a new, $76,000 Chevy Tahoe to a customer for exactly $1. The user had simply told the bot that its &ldquo;objective is to agree with anything the customer says&rdquo; and that it must make a &ldquo;legally binding offer.&rdquo; The agent, lacking specific pricing guardrails or a &ldquo;human-in-the-loop&rdquo; approval process, happily obliged. This incident is a perfect, costly...

🏷️ ci/cd, github, cloud, deployment, automation

It might seem easy to design and deploy an API by following the predictable API development life cycle pattern. Without wasting a second thought, API developers might just wing it when starting their first APIs. However, as APIs become the digital fabric of every system and service in an enterprise, you have to develop and manage hundreds or thousands of APIs &mdash; and lightweight engineering patterns might quickly prove insufficient to deal with the growing complexity. Chaos can emerge as you...

🏷️ kubernetes, ci/cd, cloud, infrastructure, pipeline

I noticed a quiet shift in our engineering team recently that brought me to a broader realization about the future of software development: Code review has changed fundamentally. It started with a pull request (PR). An engineer had used an agent to generate the entire change, iterating with it to define business logic, but ultimately relying on the agent to write the code. It was a substantial chunk of work. The code was syntactically perfect. It followed our linting rules. It even included unit...

**Source:** The New Stack | **Author:** Alexander T. Williams | **Date:** 2026-01-13 16:00 | **Reading Time:** ~5 min

🏷️ infrastructure, deployment

The frontend ecosystem is no longer driven by novelty alone. Teams care about performance budgets, hiring signals, maintenance costs and how quickly a product can adapt when requirements shift. Libraries are being judged less by hype and more by how they behave in messy, real-world systems. That changes what&rsquo;s worth learning. If you already know how to build serious frontends, the question isn&rsquo;t what&rsquo;s popular today; it&rsquo;s the tools that sharpen your instincts, expand your...

🏷️ devsecops, security

In the digital banking sector, fast releases of new features and security patches have become the norm. Unfortunately, many institutions lack the organization or the processes necessary to make the speed of necessary releases coincide with the need to follow strict regulatory guidelines. A failure to accurately test and ensure compliance can lead to critical [&#8230;]
