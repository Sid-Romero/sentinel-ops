Customizing Docker Hardened Images In Part 1 and Part 2, we established the baseline. You migrated a service to a Docker Hardened Image (DHI), witnessed the vulnerability count drop to zero, and verified the cryptographic signatures and SLSA provenance that make DHI a compliant foundation. But no matter how secure a base image is, it is useless if you can&#8217;t run your application on it.

You have a nice set of data, but how do you convey its meaning to an audience? In the latest of a series of free technology talks, the Association for Computing Machinery presented noted researcher and author Angelica Lo Duca to talk about&nbsp;&ldquo;How to Extract Meaningful Insights from Data.&rdquo; If the topic seems hopelessly broad for a one-hour tutorial, you&rsquo;ll be pleasantly surprised by how effectively she boils it down to a few key principles, ones that could be used to give a n...

That&rsquo;s w...

In a recent blog post, security researcher Jenny Guanni Qu analyzed 125,183 bug fixes in the Linux kernel &mdash; going all the way back to April of 2005, the month Git was first released to the world.
