### [The Future of AI in SRE: Preventing Failures, Not Fixing Them](https://thenewstack.io/the-future-of-ai-in-sre-preventing-failures-not-fixing-them/)

**Source:** The New Stack | **Author:** Asaf Savich | **Date:** 2026-01-17 14:00 | **Reading Time:** ~5 min

🏷️ infrastructure, observability, sre, pipeline, reliability

For years, site reliability engineering (SRE) has centered on one mission: keeping systems healthy while everything else &mdash; code, configurations and infrastructure &mdash; changes around them. But as complexity grows, even the most experienced SREs hit a wall. Logs multiply, dependencies intertwine and issues proliferate. The future of reliability engineering is no longer about reacting faster; it&rsquo;s about preventing failures before they occur. SRE has evolved through three distinct st...

### [A Developer’s Guide to Marshaling Data With JSON](https://thenewstack.io/a-developers-guide-to-marshaling-data-with-json/)

**Source:** The New Stack | **Author:** David Eastman | **Date:** 2026-01-17 13:00 | **Reading Time:** ~5 min

While code and data interplay with each other to form running programs, we still tend to concern ourselves more with how code is presented than how data is presented. While masses of streaming data can often move unseen and is truly meaningless, JavaScript Object Notation (aka JSON) was specifically designed as a standard text-based format for representing small amounts of human-readable structured data. The first time you might come across the need for this type of representation is when you wa...

### [Arcjet’s Python SDK Embeds Security in Code](https://thenewstack.io/arcjets-python-sdk-embeds-security-in-code/)

**Source:** The New Stack | **Author:** Darryl K. Taft | **Date:** 2026-01-16 22:00 | **Reading Time:** ~3 min

🏷️ security, deployment

Security platform provider Arcjet has launched a Python SDK to bring application-layer security directly into code. The SDK, now in beta, extends Arcjet&rsquo;s security platform to Python-based services and APIs to meet customer demand and AI-driven Python growth, said Arcjet Founder and CEO David Mytton. &ldquo;We started with the JavaScript ecosystem, because that&rsquo;s where most new applications are being built with full stack development,&rdquo; he told The New Stack. The company started...

### [Cloudflare Acquires Team Behind Open Source Framework Astro](https://thenewstack.io/cloudflare-acquires-team-behind-open-source-framework-astro/)

**Source:** The New Stack | **Author:** Loraine Lawson | **Date:** 2026-01-16 20:45 | **Reading Time:** ~2 min

🏷️ cloud

Cloudflare announced Friday it will acquire the Astro Technology Company team, which is responsible for the open source JavaScript web framework Astro. Astro is used by major brands like IKEA, Unilever, Visa and OpenAI to build fast, content-driven websites. The Astro team will join Cloudflare as employees. Astro itself will remain open source, to ensure its long-term growth and development, Cloudflare announced in a press release about the Astro acquisition. Search engines prioritize fast-loadi...

### [You Might Not Know This, but Your NAS Might Be a Good Docker Server](https://thenewstack.io/you-might-not-know-this-but-your-nas-might-be-a-good-docker-server/)

**Source:** The New Stack | **Author:** Jack Wallen | **Date:** 2026-01-16 18:00 | **Reading Time:** ~5 min

🏷️ cloud, docker

Recently, I procured a Zettlab AI NAS. This was mostly to be used to house a metric ton of video files that I work with, as my external drives were constantly getting full of clips that I no longer needed to work on, but didn&rsquo;t want to get rid of (you know&hellip; just in case). After deploying the NAS, I started poking around and noticed it had an app store. Curiosity got the best of me, so I decided to give the app store a look. As I expected, the usual trove of apps was to be found. How...

### [SLMs vs. LLMs: Why Smaller AI Models Win in Business](https://thenewstack.io/slms-vs-llms-why-smaller-ai-models-win-in-business/)

**Source:** The New Stack | **Author:** Sean Falconer | **Date:** 2026-01-16 17:00 | **Reading Time:** ~8 min

🏷️ pipeline, infrastructure, reliability, deployment

Enterprise AI inherited the consumer model of AI, but it&rsquo;s the wrong one for most business-to-business (B2B) problems. In the consumer world, the appeal of generative AI is its role as an omniscient polymath. A single interface can write a poem, debug code, plan a vacation and answer trivia pulled from across the public internet. This makes sense in an open world, where the range of possible questions is unbounded and success is subjective. When AI must handle anything a user might ask, sc...

### [Orchestration: The Key to Integrating AI with Legacy Systems](https://thenewstack.io/orchestration-the-key-to-integrating-ai-with-legacy-systems/)

**Source:** The New Stack | **Author:** Jakob Freund | **Date:** 2026-01-16 16:00 | **Reading Time:** ~4 min

🏷️ reliability, monitoring, automation

In today&rsquo;s enterprise landscape, AI may dominate the conversation, but legacy systems still underpin mission-critical operations for many &mdash; if not most &mdash; businesses. At the same time, organizations are investing heavily in AI to automate more. However, many of these AI capabilities end up layered on systems never designed to support them, creating a patchwork of disconnected tools. It&rsquo;s no surprise that, according to the NANDA project at MIT, only 5% of AI pilots move int...

### [Memory for AI Agents: A New Paradigm of Context Engineering](https://thenewstack.io/memory-for-ai-agents-a-new-paradigm-of-context-engineering/)

**Source:** The New Stack | **Author:** Nicole Seah | **Date:** 2026-01-16 15:00 | **Reading Time:** ~6 min

🏷️ infrastructure, cloud, automation

For today&rsquo;s AI agents, memory is a moat. Every conversation counts, but traditional large language models (LLMs) are stateless &mdash; they start each interaction without any context or memory, leaving power untapped and insight lost. Imagining new paradigms of agent memory has become one of the most urgent frontiers in AI development, allowing for active formation and updating of memories, so agents can use all past interactions in a meaningful way. There are many parallels to human memor...
