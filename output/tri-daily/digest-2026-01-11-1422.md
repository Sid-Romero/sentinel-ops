🏷️ docker

If 2025 was &ldquo;the year of type checking and language server protocols&rdquo; for Python, will 2026 be the year of the type server protocol? &ldquo;Transformative&rdquo; developments like free threading were said to be coming to Python in 2026, along with performance-improving &ldquo;lazy&rdquo; imports for Python modules. We&rsquo;ll (hopefully) also be seeing improved Python agent frameworks. But 2026 could even see a change in change itself &mdash; in the ways that Python changes are prop...

### [Build Cheaper, Safer, Auditable AI with SLMs and RAG](https://thenewstack.io/build-cheaper-safer-auditable-ai-with-slms-and-rag/)

Enterprises experimenting with large language models (LLMs) often encounter the same challenges once pilot projects move into production. Infrastructure costs escalate rapidly, response times become unpredictable under load and outputs are difficult to audit or explain. While LLMs remain useful for exploration and prototyping, their size and generality make them difficult to operate sustainably within enterprise platforms. A practical alternative emerging in production systems is the combination...

### [Beyond Python: Why LLMs Need More Stable, Open Source Code](https://thenewstack.io/beyond-python-why-llms-need-more-stable-open-source-code/)

In the future dreams of Large Language Models, there will be no need for human intervention and they will write code in a highly efficient form unreadable to us. Perhaps they will write directly in binary. But for now, we need our LLM assistants to write readable code, in an established programming language. So what languages do LLMs prefer to use today? In terms of the programming language most popular with human developers, where we assume models get their training material from, the choices s...

🏷️ security

You&rsquo;ve may have heard that Arch Linux isn&rsquo;t exactly the easiest Linux distribution to install or use. What if I told you that there&rsquo;s a distribution based on Arch Linux that makes it easy enough for just about anyone to use? Well, that&rsquo;s a reality, and the distribution in question is Manjaro. Manjaro came into being in 2011 and didn&rsquo;t hit the beta stage until two years later. The big selling point of this take on Arch Linux is its ease of installation. Where Arch Li...
