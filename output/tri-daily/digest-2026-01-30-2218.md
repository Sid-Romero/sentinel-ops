🏷️ github

Anthropic is extending Cowork with a plugin system that bundles skills, connectors, slash commands, and sub-agents, giving non-developers the kind of extensibility that Claude Code users are already familiar with. Cowork, which launched only two weeks ago, is Anthropic&rsquo;s version of Claude Code for knowledge workers who don&rsquo;t want to write code but want to have a similar agentic tool that helps them create or clean up documents, organize files, and summarize large numbers of locally s...

🏷️ reliability, security, automation

If 2025 was the year of AI adoption, with 88% of organizations now using AI across at least one business function, 2026 is likely to be the year of the AI incident. As AI systems are deployed at speed, gaps in governance, oversight, and resilience are surfacing. In this environment, IT operations (ITOps) teams must prepare for AI incidents and rethink traditional operations management processes to reflect the changing nature of risk.

🏷️ aws, cloud, deployment

Your LinkedIn is suddenly filled with posts and job ads for the forward-deployed engineer (FDE) role. What does that even mean? The term FDE was&nbsp;coined by Palantir, which provides data integration and analysis platforms for governments, including the defense industry. In the military, a forward-deployed soldier is stationed overseas, ready for rapid response.

🏷️ reliability

For decades, I used VirtualBox for all my virtual machine (VM) needs. I could use it as a graphical user interface (GUI), or I could run it from the command line. It was easy to work with, was cross-platform, and rarely caused me any problems. Until it didn&rsquo;t. Over the past few years, I cannot tell you how many times I wound up with a broken VirtualBox installation that required me to completely remove the software and reinstall it. Generally speaking, it was a hassle, but the solution wor...
