Cluster API brings declarative management to Kubernetes cluster lifecycle, allowing users and platform teams to define the desired state of clusters and rely on controllers to continuously reconcile toward it. Similar to how you can use StatefulSets or Deployments in Kubernetes to manage a group of Pods, in Cluster API you can use KubeadmControlPlane to manage a set of control plane Machines, or you can use MachineDeployments to manage a group of worker Nodes. The Cluster API v1.12.0 release exp...

### [How AI coding makes developers 56% faster and 19% slower](https://thenewstack.io/how-ai-coding-makes-developers-56-faster-and-19-slower/)

**Source:** The New Stack | **Author:** Steve Fenton | **Date:** 2026-02-09 12:00 | **Reading Time:** ~8 min

🏷️ github, cloud, pipeline, deployment

There&rsquo;s a growing body of research around AI coding assistants with a confusing range of conflicting results. This is to be expected when the landscape is constantly shifting from coding suggestions to agent-based workflows to Ralph Wiggum loops and beyond. The Reichenbach Falls in Switzerland has a drop of 250 metres and a flow rate of 180-300 cubic metres per minute (enough to fill about 1,500 bathtubs). This is comparable to the rate of change in tools and techniques around coding assis...

### [Will AI Kill the OSS Star?](https://devops.com/will-ai-kill-the-oss-star/)

**Source:** DevOps.com | **Author:** Alan Shimel | **Date:** 2026-02-09 11:54 | **Reading Time:** ~1 min

As AI-driven development accelerates, open source software faces an uncomfortable paradox: Usage is rising while engagement, sustainability and community economics quietly erode. AI isn’t eliminating OSS, but it is reshaping how code is written, discovered and maintained. The result may not be the death of open source, but the end of its long reign as the default foundation of modern software.

### [IDEcline: How the world’s most powerful coding tools became second-class citizens overnight](https://thenewstack.io/ide-vs-desktop-agent/)

**Source:** The New Stack | **Author:** Janakiram MSV | **Date:** 2026-02-08 17:00 | **Reading Time:** ~7 min

🏷️ github, security, cloud

During the early phase of my career, I used to spend eight hours a day inside the Visual Studio IDE. Fast-forward to today, and developers spend more time delegating work than coding in an IDE. That shift points us to something dramatically different &ndash; from writing and editing code to orchestrating coding agents. It is not just autocompletion bolted onto existing workflow, but a fundamental shift in how software is being built. The IDE still matters, but it is no longer on the main stage. ...
