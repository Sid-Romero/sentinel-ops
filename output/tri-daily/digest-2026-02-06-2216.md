### [Reduce Vulnerability Noise with VEX: Wiz + Docker Hardened Images](https://www.docker.com/blog/reduce-vulnerability-noise-with-vex-wiz-docker-hardened-images/)

**Source:** Docker Blog | **Author:** Dan Berezin Stelzer | **Date:** 2026-02-05 23:25 | **Reading Time:** ~4 min

🏷️ infrastructure, devsecops, docker, deployment, cloud

Open source components power most modern applications. A new generation of hardened container images can establish a more secure foundation, but even with hardened images, vulnerability scanners often return dozens or hundreds of CVEs with little prioritization. This noise slows teams down and complicates security triage. The VEX (Vulnerability Exploitability eXchange) standard addresses the problem by providing information on whether a specific vulnerability actually impacts an organization&#82...

### [Operant AI targets ‘shadow’ AI agents with real-time security platform](https://thenewstack.io/operant-ai-targets-shadow-ai-agents-with-real-time-security-platform/)

**Source:** The New Stack | **Author:** Steven J. Vaughan-Nichols | **Date:** 2026-02-06 18:15 | **Reading Time:** ~4 min

🏷️ cloud, observability, security

As AI agents fan out across enterprise apps, APIs, and data stores, they&rsquo;re creating a security blind spot: autonomous systems with access to sensitive data that move faster than security teams can track. Operant AI&lsquo;s new Agent Protector platform aims to close that gap with real-time zero-trust controls built specifically for agentic workloads. Agent Protector is a real-time security platform that monitors, governs, and enforces zero-trust controls for AI agents. Positioned as a secu...

### [Is the SaaSpocalypse nigh? The era of paying for software seats may be ending.](https://thenewstack.io/dawn-of-a-saaspocalypse/)

**Source:** The New Stack | **Author:** Janakiram MSV | **Date:** 2026-02-06 16:29 | **Reading Time:** ~6 min

In December 2024, Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella appeared on the BG2 podcast and made a prediction that felt provocative and hyped. Business applications delivered as Software as a Service (SaaS) would collapse in the era of agentic AI, he said, because they are essentially CRUD databases layered on top of them. That logic would migrate to the AI tier, and the applications themselves would become irrelevant. It sounded bold, and maybe even a bit dramatic. But almost a year later, we are witnessing ...

🏷️ infrastructure

Pavlo Baron, co-founder and CEO of Platform Engineering Labs, unpacks what’s changing in platform engineering as AI reshapes who gets to build, and how infrastructure actually gets managed. Baron traces the origin story back to his time building high-scale systems at Instana (which exited to IBM in 2020), where the reality of “always-on” platforms made [&#8230;]

### [How Homepage simplifies monitoring your self-hosted services](https://thenewstack.io/homepage-is-your-one-stop-shop-for-monitoring-and-viewing-all-of-the-services-you-depend-on/)

**Source:** The New Stack | **Author:** Jack Wallen | **Date:** 2026-02-06 16:00 | **Reading Time:** ~5 min

🏷️ monitoring, cloud, security, docker

Slowly but surely, I&rsquo;ve been migrating over to self-hosted services so I can finally cut the cord to third parties. By keeping things within my LAN, I enjoy more security and privacy than I would if I continued using cloud hosts. The problem is, I wind up with a lot of different services running that I have to then access via different IP addresses and ports. But what if I wanted to simply (and quickly) view the status of those services, take a gander at statistics, or even confirm that my...
