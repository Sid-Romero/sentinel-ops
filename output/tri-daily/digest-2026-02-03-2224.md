🏷️ cloud

We’re excited to launch a new video celebrating the energy, people, and community that make KubeCon + CloudNativeCon what it is. One of the most powerful things about KubeCon + CloudNativeCon is the sheer scale and diversity of voices it brings together. As CNCF project maintainer Kingdon Barrett shares in the video,&nbsp;“The best thing about KubeCon + CloudNativeCon is the sheer number of projects that are represented here… it’s amazing to get to meet people from all over the world with all th...

**Source:** HashiCorp Blog | **Author:** Chandni Patel | **Date:** 2026-02-03 17:00 | **Reading Time:** ~7 min

🏷️ ci/cd, security, pipeline, monitoring, cloud

PCI DSS (Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard) defines technical and operational requirements for protecting payment data. Recently this standard has raised the bar for how organizations protect payment data, especially in cloud-native environments. With the release of PCI DSS 4.0, tatic credentials, hard-coded secrets, and limited visibility across development pipelines are no longer just bad practices, they are audit risks that could result in significant fines. Organizations are being...

### [Anthropic Research Shows Trade-Off Between AI Productivity and Developer Mastery](https://devops.com/anthropic-research-shows-trade-off-between-ai-productivity-and-developer-mastery/)

**Source:** DevOps.com | **Author:** James Maguire | **Date:** 2026-02-03 19:04 | **Reading Time:** ~1 min

Artificial intelligence tools are now a routine part of today’s software development, promising faster output and reduced workloads. But new research from Anthropic suggests that when developers rely on AI while learning new skills, those productivity gains may come at the expense of understanding. In a randomized controlled study involving 52 mostly junior software engineers, [&#8230;]

### [Moltbook: Hype or the Singularity?](https://thenewstack.io/moltbook-the-singularity-or-hype/)

**Source:** The New Stack | **Author:** Steven J. Vaughan-Nichols | **Date:** 2026-02-03 17:30 | **Reading Time:** ~4 min

🏷️ security, cloud

Hysteria continues to build over Moltbook, the so-called AI Agent social network. If you believe Elon Musk, Moltbook is at the &ldquo;very early stages of the singularity,&rdquo; which is when AI outstrips human intelligence, and we&rsquo;re either on our way to Terminators or Iain Banks&rsquo; utopian The Culture. Since Musk names SpaceX retrieval ships after Culture ships, we know which way he&rsquo;s betting. Or, as Stackernerd puts it, it&rsquo;s &ldquo;a reminder that most AI &lsquo;breakth...

🏷️ security, deployment, aws, kubernetes

We warned you! Today, Ingress NGINX is still being used by 50% of Kubernetes users to manage incoming traffic, but&nbsp;it&rsquo;s long been slotted for retirement. We warned you, but did you listen? Nope. After the news was out, 44% of you were still using it, according to a Reddit survey! Wow. Seriously, are you folks gluttons for punishment? Because I hate to break it to you, but the Kubernetes Steering and Security Response Committees just announced on January 29th that &ldquo;In March 2026,...

🏷️ observability, monitoring

The real cost of poor observability isn’t just downtime; it’s lost trust, wasted engineering hours, and the strain of constant firefighting. But most teams are still working across fragmented monitoring tools, juggling endless alerts, dashboards, and escalation systems that barely talk to one another, which acts like chaos disguised as control. The result is alert [&#8230;]

🏷️ devops, kubernetes

Launched in 2008, the audio streaming platform Spotify has more than 200 million active users worldwide. Initially, Spotify relied on a homegrown container orchestration system called Helios. In 2017, this became a bottleneck, and the IT team implemented Kubernetes, which increased speed while reducing costs. With Kubernetes, the Spotify backend team can develop new services [&#8230;]

🏷️ azure, security, reliability, aws, cloud

Software reliability is a persistent problem for developers because IT systems are built on unreliable components: hardware degrades; software has bugs; networks drop packets; large language models (LLMs) hallucinate; power fails. An executing program runs to completion unless: A. The program or OS encounters a bug B. An external failure, such as a machine losing power or rebooting, occurs C. There&rsquo;s a hardware failure Here&rsquo;s a small example that illustrates the problem. As I&rsquo;m...

### [Unlocking AI’s full potential: Why context is everything](https://thenewstack.io/context-is-everything-sales-force-data-360/)

**Source:** The New Stack | **Author:** Rahul Auradkar | **Date:** 2026-02-02 22:31 | **Reading Time:** ~4 min

🏷️ infrastructure, cloud

AI is ubiquitous in both the consumer and enterprise sectors. Yet few organizations are realizing AI&rsquo;s full potential. Why? AI agents must make decisions and take actions based on a limited subset of overall data. Result: too much guesswork, the occasional hallucination, and failure to extract full value from AI. The downfall of enterprise AI, then, is agents that falter without a comprehensive understanding of data, both customer- and business-derived. Companies need to be able to pivot f...

### [Introducing Node Readiness Controller](https://kubernetes.io/blog/2026/02/03/introducing-node-readiness-controller/)

**Source:** Kubernetes Blog | **Date:** 2026-02-03 02:00 | **Reading Time:** ~3 min

🏷️ github, monitoring, cloud, infrastructure, observability

In the standard Kubernetes model, a node’s suitability for workloads hinges on a single binary &quot;Ready&quot; condition. However, in modern Kubernetes environments, nodes require complex infrastructure dependencies—such as network agents, storage drivers, GPU firmware, or custom health checks—to be fully operational before they can reliably host pods. Today, on behalf of the Kubernetes project, I am announcing the Node Readiness Controller. This project introduces a declarative system for man...
