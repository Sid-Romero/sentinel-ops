If you've ever had to… Troubleshoot a production outage caused by an expired service account token Audit a codebase only to find API keys hard-coded in configuration files Tried to track down which CI/CD pipeline has access to which cloud resources …you understand the problem. Non-human identities (NHIs) — service accounts, API keys, OAuth tokens, certificates, and machine credentials — now vastly outnumber human users in most organizations, yet we're still managing them with approaches designed...

The march to build comprehensive software application development platforms aligned and optimized for the AI-first era is running at a breakneck pace. Latest to join the current land grab and pledge allegiance to the delivery of high-value AI-driven outcomes is Helsinki, Finland-based Eficode. Pronounced (exactly as it sounds) Eficode in American English, but presumably given [&#8230;]

🏷️ cloud, infrastructure, monitoring, automation

IBM, the venerable tech company, has been on an acquisition binge in the last few years, buying Red Hat and HashiCorp, and it recently announced plans to buy Confluent. There&rsquo;s a method to this shopping spree, according to Sanil Nambiar, client engagement lead, AI for networks, at IBM: Assembling the infrastructure organizations will need for AI. &ldquo;The strategy, obviously, is hybrid cloud, data and AI and automation working together as an architecture,&rdquo; Nambiar told me in this e...

🏷️ reliability, cloud, observability, infrastructure, deployment

In &ldquo;Battle-Tested Tips for a Better NoSQL Migration,&rdquo; I shared my top strategies for planning, executing and de-risking a NoSQL database migration. I discussed key steps like schema and data migration, data validation and important considerations such as technology switches, tooling, edge cases and the idea that you might not need to migrate all your data. Now, let&rsquo;s analyze how teams actually migrated their data &mdash; what challenges they faced, trade-offs, how they proceede...

🏷️ helm, automation, reliability, prometheus, kubernetes

In a Kubernetes cluster, CPU and memory requests are both a cost dial and a reliability dial. They&rsquo;re how you tell the scheduler what a pod &ldquo;needs,&rdquo; and they&rsquo;re what node autoscalers and horizontal pod autoscalers (HPAs) react to when deciding whether to add capacity or replicas. The problem is that requests drift. They get set during early development or a past traffic shape, then workloads evolve, and the numbers don&rsquo;t. Nobody wants to hand-tune requests forever, ...

### [Operations Shift: Assistants to Autonomous Multiagent Systems](https://thenewstack.io/operations-shift-assistants-to-autonomous-multiagent-systems/)

🏷️ infrastructure, deployment, automation

AI assistants have become table stakes across modern enterprise operations. Drafting emails, summarizing interactions and surfacing next-best actions are no longer differentiators, they are expectations. But assistants are not the story here. The real shift happening across operational systems is structural. Productivity support has turned into autonomous execution and, increasingly, coordinated networks of intelligent agents that own outcomes. This changes not just what operational platforms do...

### [Forget Predictions: Tech Leaders’ Actual 2026 Resolutions](https://thenewstack.io/forget-predictions-tech-leaders-actual-2026-resolutions/)

🏷️ infrastructure, security

People have strong feelings about New Year&rsquo;s resolutions. I know people who spend their entire December reflecting and then in January planning for the year ahead. I also know people who think it&rsquo;s all a waste of time. Regardless of where your opinion lands on this spectrum, can we agree that resolutions are better than predictions? We are hammered this time of year with everyone&rsquo;s predictions about what will happen next. It&rsquo;s easy to make a prediction publicly, because w...

**Source:** The New Stack | **Author:** Camille Crowell-Lee | **Date:** 2026-01-07 16:00 | **Reading Time:** ~6 min

🏷️ infrastructure, observability, security

A recent survey by JetBrains of more than 23,000 developers found that nearly half (49%) now use AI regularly for coding and other development-related tasks. Among those developers, 73% report saving up to four hours per week through AI assistance. But a key question remains: What are developers actually doing with that extra time? While large language models (LLMs) have proven remarkably effective as coding assistants, especially because developer frameworks are so well-documented, they still h...

### [Kubernetes v1.35: A Better Way to Pass Service Account Tokens to CSI Drivers](https://kubernetes.io/blog/2026/01/07/kubernetes-v1-35-csi-sa-tokens-secrets-field-beta/)

**Source:** Kubernetes Blog | **Date:** 2026-01-07 18:30 | **Reading Time:** ~5 min

🏷️ helm, kubernetes, azure, deployment

If you maintain a CSI driver that uses service account tokens, Kubernetes v1.35 brings a refinement you'll want to know about. Since the introduction of the TokenRequests feature, service account tokens requested by CSI drivers have been passed to them through the volume_context field. While this has worked, it's not the ideal place for sensitive information, and we've seen instances where tokens were accidentally logged in CSI drivers. Kubernetes v1.35 introduces a beta solution to address this...
