🏷️ docker, infrastructure, pipeline, reliability, ci/cd

Why a “protected repo”? Modern teams depend on public container images, yet most environments lack a single, auditable control point for what gets pulled and when. This often leads to three operational challenges: Inconsistent or improvised base images that drift across teams and pipelines. Exposure to new CVEs when tags remain unchanged but upstream content does not. Unreliable workflows due to rate limiting, throttling, or pull interruptions. A protected repository addresses these challenges b...

🏷️ deployment, automation, reliability, cloud, security

The ability to connect AI agents to external systems defines their practical utility. Without tools, an agent is limited to generating text based on its training data. With tools, an agent becomes an autonomous actor capable of retrieving real-time information, executing code, calling APIs and interacting with enterprise systems. Google&rsquo;s Agent Development Kit (ADK) provides a comprehensive tool integration framework that determines how agents extend their capabilities beyond the language ...

Let’s get the obvious out of the way right up front. AI isn’t a person. Thank you, Captain Obvious. We’re all on the same page. And yet, when we announced that AI is Techstrong’s “Person of the Year” for our Predict 2026 virtual event on January 15, a few folks felt compelled to remind us [&#8230;]

Frontend developer and educator Kent Dodds has some good news for frontend developers confused about which React-based framework to choose. &ldquo;For those who are looking for a new framework, you&rsquo;re starting a new project, you cannot make a wrong choice. All of these frameworks are fabulous,&rdquo; he told audiences at React Conf, which last week released videos from the event. &ldquo;React is doing so much more for us now.

Earlier this year, the platform team at a global bank introduced a new workflow for developers to provision cloud environments on demand. The goal was to improve delivery speed and reduce dependency on manual approvals. The infrastructure rolled out smoothly. Within weeks, teams were launching workloads across AWS, Google Cloud Platform (GCP) and Microsoft Azure. Then the questions started. Finance asked why certain environments were running in high-cost regions. Security flagged resources missi...

🏷️ cloud, deployment, security, automation

Sharing digital data is one of the most important and riskiest parts of modern business. Multiple times a day, organizations transfer sensitive information &mdash; customer data, medical test results, financial information, code, sales reports &mdash; to internal and external partners. But without guardrails, this in-transit data is vulnerable to theft or loss. Managed file transfer (MFT) solutions put guardrails in place. Other solutions &mdash; including secure file transfer protocol (SFTP) an...

AI has moved decisively from experimentation to execution. It now sits at the core of enterprise transformation strategies, reshaping the way organizations think about performance, resilience, risk and accountability. As AI becomes operational rather than exploratory, governance has emerged as the defining priority for IT and cloud infrastructure leaders tasked with running the digital backbone of the enterprise. This shift is reflected clearly in the data. A recent survey from Komprise on unstr...

🏷️ reliability, pipeline, security, deployment

AI leaders have, for the last couple of years, obsessed over benchmarks, debating whether GPT-4, Claude or Gemini holds the crown. This enterprise AI conversation has been dominated by a single metric: Model performance. But this fixation on raw &ldquo;intelligence&rdquo; overlooks the most critical factor in successful deployment. As these models converge in capability, the battleground is shifting. The differentiator for the next generation of enterprise applications won&rsquo;t be the model i...
