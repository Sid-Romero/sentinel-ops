If you&rsquo;ve ever used Linux, you might have heard of Vim. Don&rsquo;t run away just yet. Yes, Vim is not exactly the easiest text editor in the world, but it is one of the most powerful available. Vim isn&rsquo;t just a text editor; it&rsquo;s a highly configurable and powerful text editor that&rsquo;s popular among programmers because it&rsquo;s a very efficient tool for coding in the command line. Vim allows users to issue complex commands via keyboard shortcuts, so your fingers never have...

🏷️ infrastructure, deployment, observability, github, security

In cybersecurity, going solo rarely works. Historically, frameworks like CVEs, ATT&amp;CK and software bills of materials (SBOMs) have shown that shared languages of risk turn scattered efforts into coordinated victories. Now, with AI running faster than ever and growing its own &ldquo;muscles and tools,&rdquo; a similar shift is overdue. AI agents can fetch data, take actions and make decisions in milliseconds. Model Context Protocol (MCP) standardizes the way they connect to tools and APIs, wh...

🏷️ devops, monitoring, gitlab, cloud, automation

The year 2025 started out with a bang, with the AI community collectively deciding to use the MCP format to build agentic systems, and moving on to a focus on building operational AI frameworks. For IT operations, however, getting useful work out of AI agents still required considerable planning. Pushing code changes into production, for the time being, still requires human oversight. In a TNS survey,&nbsp;Kevin Reeuwijk, a distinguished architect for&nbsp;Spectro Cloud pointed out that &ldquo;W...

This is the second of two parts. Read Part 1: How to Get DNS Right: A Guide to Common Failure Modes Monitoring DNS is not simply a matter of checking whether a record resolves. A comprehensive approach follows four key principles: Test from multiple networks and regions to avoid blind spots. Validate both correctness and speed, since slow answers can harm user flows even when technically valid. Measure continuously, not periodically, because many issues manifest as short-lived or regionalized in...

🏷️ infrastructure, devops, reliability, automation, security

If you work in DevOps, you’ve heard it a thousand times: “Do more with less.” More automation, more security, more reliability—but with the same (or fewer) people. Meanwhile, your development teams keep growing, pushing out new features at breakneck speed. Yet somehow, the infrastructure team is supposed to scale magically to keep up. Let’s be [&#8230;]

### [Run Real Python in Browsers With Pyodide and WebAssembly](https://thenewstack.io/run-real-python-in-browsers-with-pyodide-and-webassembly/)

**Source:** The New Stack | **Author:** Jessica Wachtel | **Date:** 2025-12-30 23:30 | **Reading Time:** ~5 min

There are many ways to bring Python to the browser (thanks, WebAssembly). But there&rsquo;s only one way to bring Python&rsquo;s full functionality (really no compromises) to the browser: Pyodide. Pyodide is a full Python runtime compiled to WebAssembly that allows you to run standard Python code directly in the browser. Yes, other tools exist, but the functionality has more limits than with Pyodide. Pyodide is powerful because it&rsquo;s a port of the CPython interpreter to WebAssembly (Wasm). ...
