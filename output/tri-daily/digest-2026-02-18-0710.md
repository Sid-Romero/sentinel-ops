When it comes to building dynamic and real-work solutions, developers need to stitch multiple databases (relational, document, graph, vector, time-series, search) together and build complex API layers to integrate them. This generates significant complexity, cost, and operational risk, and reduces speed of innovation. More often than not, developers end up focusing on building glue code and managing infrastructure rather than building application logic. For AI use cases, using multiple databases...

### [Simplify managing your Docker compose files with this handy tool](https://thenewstack.io/simplify-managing-your-docker-compose-files-with-this-handy-tool/)

🏷️ docker, github, security

The Docker run command is a great introduction to running containers. It&rsquo;s simple, it&rsquo;s quick, and it&rsquo;s fairly easy to learn. It&rsquo;s also a bit limiting. For one thing, those run commands can grow quite long, and just viewing them in your terminal window can be a real challenge. As well, it&rsquo;s harder to edit those commands before running them. You might want to alter the port, which means you&rsquo;ll need to use your keyboard arrow keys to navigate back, one character...

### [From notebooks to nodes: Architecting production-ready AI infrastructure](https://thenewstack.io/production-ai-infrastructure-guide/)

The transition from running machine learning models in Colab notebooks to operational, high-traffic applications requires significant changes in infrastructure setup. The notebook environment maintains fixed dependencies that become inactive when the kernel stops. Fortunately, users can easily restart it. The production environment requires immediate response times due to financial implications, as GPU resources fluctuate and data patterns shift. &ldquo;The transition from running machine learni...

### [The “funhouse mirror”: How AI reflects the hidden truths of your software pipeline](https://thenewstack.io/ai-velocity-debt-accelerator/)

AI is the epitome of moving fast and breaking things. But where has the rigor gone, asks Thoughtworks CTO Rachel Laycock. Where are the guardrails? AI may be dubbed the great disruptor, but it&rsquo;s really just an accelerator of whatever you already have. The 2025 DORA report places AI&rsquo;s primary role in software development as that of an amplifier &mdash; a funhouse mirror that reflects back the good, bad, and ugly of your whole pipeline. AI is proven to be impactful on the individual de...

### [Anthropic’s new Claude Sonnet 4.6 promises Opus-level coding at Sonnet pricing](https://thenewstack.io/claude-sonnet-46-launch/)

**Source:** The New Stack | **Author:** Frederic Lardinois | **Date:** 2026-02-17 18:00 | **Reading Time:** ~3 min

Anthropic on Tuesday launched Claude Sonnet 4.6, the latest version of its mainstream model. This new version promises to almost match the company&rsquo;s flagship Opus 4.6 model, which launched barely two weeks ago, in most tasks, but at the significantly lower price of $3/$15 per million input/output tokens (compared to $5/$25 for the Opus model). Just like the previous version and Opus 4.6, Sonnet 4.6 offers a 1-million-token context window in beta. Benchmarks Compared to the older Sonnet mod...

&ldquo;The API landscape is a mess, and very few people understand it,&rdquo; Kin Lane, API industry veteran and founder of Naftiko, tells The New Stack. Some days it feels like we are living in an XKCD cartoon. xkcd.com Organizations don&rsquo;t typically migrate legacy systems from one spec to another as new ideas emerge. Instead, they accumulate layers of integration standards over time, with each era leaving behind systems that are too costly or risky to excavate. &ldquo;I get a call from a ...
