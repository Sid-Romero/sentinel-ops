### [Goodbye Plugins: MCP Is Becoming the Universal Interface for AI](https://thenewstack.io/goodbye-plugins-mcp-is-becoming-the-universal-interface-for-ai/)

🏷️ monitoring, deployment, security, observability

Three months ago, I spent two weeks building a custom plugin to connect our AI assistant to our internal CRM system. Last week, I replaced it with a Model Context Protocol (MCP) server that took four hours to implement, and it works with every AI model in our stack. This is not just a productivity win, but a glimpse into a fundamental shift happening across the AI ecosystem. It feels like the era of fragmented plugins is ending, and MCP is emerging as the universal interface that could standardi...

### [Martin Fowler on Preparing for AI’s Nondeterministic Computing](https://thenewstack.io/martin-fowler-on-preparing-for-ais-nondeterministic-computing/)

Martin Fowler, Thoughtworks chief scientist and long-time expert on object-oriented programming, views AI as the biggest shift in programming he has seen in his entire career. In an interview on the Pragmatic Engineer podcast, hosted by Gergely Orosz, Fowler admitted about AI that, &ldquo;We&rsquo;re still learning how to do this.&rdquo; The closest parallel for the industry would be the shift away from assembly language.

🏷️ aws

CrunchBang was a Debian-based Linux distribution that was minimal and pretty popular among hard-core users. CrunchBang eventually ended, but gave way to the likes of CrunchBang++ and even one of my favorites, BunsenLabs Linux. There was yet another spinoff of CrunchBang, ArchBang. As you can guess, this take was based on Arch Linux, but retained the Openbox window manager to keep the lightweight speed. ArchBang fell to the wayside, only to be resurrected as GreenBang. It&rsquo;s kind of confusin...

🏷️ cloud

In a world where AI was suddenly everywhere, what will be remembered about 2025? How can we tell future generations what it looked like when miraculous surprises mixed with day-to-day disappointments in a never-ending cycle of worry and hope &hellip; In an annual tradition, it&rsquo;s time for our &ldquo;final closing ceremony&rdquo; for the year gone by, our carefully-curated collection of small moments with big implications. And in 2025 we started seeing AI&rsquo;s impact on society &mdash; fo...
