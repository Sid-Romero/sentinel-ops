🏷️ infrastructure, observability, security, github, deployment

In cybersecurity, going solo rarely works. Historically, frameworks like CVEs, ATT&amp;CK and software bills of materials (SBOMs) have shown that shared languages of risk turn scattered efforts into coordinated victories. Now, with AI running faster than ever and growing its own &ldquo;muscles and tools,&rdquo; a similar shift is overdue. AI agents can fetch data, take actions and make decisions in milliseconds. Model Context Protocol (MCP) standardizes the way they connect to tools and APIs, wh...

🏷️ automation, cloud, monitoring, gitlab, devops

The year 2025 started out with a bang, with the AI community collectively deciding to use the MCP format to build agentic systems, and moving on to a focus on building operational AI frameworks. For IT operations, however, getting useful work out of AI agents still required considerable planning. Pushing code changes into production, for the time being, still requires human oversight. In a TNS survey,&nbsp;Kevin Reeuwijk, a distinguished architect for&nbsp;Spectro Cloud pointed out that &ldquo;W...

This is the second of two parts. Read Part 1: How to Get DNS Right: A Guide to Common Failure Modes Monitoring DNS is not simply a matter of checking whether a record resolves. A comprehensive approach follows four key principles: Test from multiple networks and regions to avoid blind spots. Validate both correctness and speed, since slow answers can harm user flows even when technically valid. Measure continuously, not periodically, because many issues manifest as short-lived or regionalized in...
