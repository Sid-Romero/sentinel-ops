### [Kubernetes WG Serving concludes following successful advancement of AI inference support](https://www.cncf.io/blog/2026/02/26/kubernetes-wg-serving-concludes-following-successful-advancement-of-ai-inference-support/)

**Source:** CNCF Blog | **Author:** Yuan Tang, on behalf of Kubernetes WG Serving Co-Chairs | **Date:** 2026-02-26 13:30 | **Reading Time:** ~2 min

🏷️ kubernetes, infrastructure

The Kubernetes Working Group (WG) Serving was created to support development of the AI inference stack on Kubernetes. The goal of this working group was to ensure that Kubernetes is an orchestration platform of choice for inference workloads. This goal has been accomplished, and the working group is now being disbanded. WG Serving formed workstreams to collect requirements from various model servers, hardware providers, and inference vendors. This work resulted in a common understanding of infer...

🏷️ helm, gitops, deployment, github, cloud

The Gateway API isn&#8217;t just an &#8220;Ingress v2&#8221;, it&#8217;s an entirely revamped approach for exposing services from within Kubernetes and eliminates the need of encoding routing capabilities into vendor-specific, unstructured annotations. In this post, we will explore how to expose WebAssembly applications built using the CNCF Spin framework and served by SpinKube using the Gateway API. What is SpinKube SpinKube, a CNCF sandbox project, is an open-source stack for running serverles...

### [Docker Model Runner Brings vLLM to macOS with Apple Silicon](https://www.docker.com/blog/docker-model-runner-vllm-metal-macos/)

**Source:** Docker Blog | **Author:** Yiwen Xu | **Date:** 2026-02-26 14:42 | **Reading Time:** ~6 min

🏷️ docker, github

vLLM has quickly become the go-to inference engine for developers who need high-throughput LLM serving. We brought vLLM to Docker Model Runner for NVIDIA GPUs on Linux, then extended it to Windows via WSL2. That changes today. Docker Model Runner now supports vllm-metal, a new backend that brings vLLM inference to macOS using Apple Silicon&#8217;s Metal GPU. If you have a Mac with an M-series chip, you can now run MLX models through vLLM with the same OpenAI-compatible API, same Anthropic-compat...

### [Secure remote access without the ‘portal tax’: Boundary vs other vendors](https://www.hashicorp.com/blog/secure-remote-access-without-the-portal-tax-boundary-vs-other-vendors)

**Source:** HashiCorp Blog | **Author:** Saptaparni Nandy | **Date:** 2026-02-25 17:00 | **Reading Time:** ~5 min

🏷️ security

Secure remote access today is tedious. Most VPN and privileged access management (PAM) tools are a huge burden because they force users — especially engineers — to change how they work. The remote access landscape is cluttered with proprietary clients and web-based proxies. If a developer wants to SSH into a production server or access a database, they usually have to: Stop their actual work Launch a VPN Log in to a web portal Search for a &quot;safe&quot;/target account (with many of the incumb...

### [Why the secret to scaling AI isn’t a better model, it’s a simpler foundation](https://thenewstack.io/ai-unified-data-foundation/)

**Source:** The New Stack | **Author:** Ajay Khanna | **Date:** 2026-02-26 13:00 | **Reading Time:** ~6 min

🏷️ observability, deployment, pipeline, cloud, monitoring

A recent study from MIT&rsquo;s NANDA initiative highlights a persistent challenge in enterprise AI adoption. Despite heavy investment and experimentation, roughly 95% of corporate AI efforts fail to deliver clear, measurable value. Models and agents dominate the current AI conversation, but the true success or failure of real-world AI applications hinges on their underlying data architecture. Developers can spin up agents, run experiments, and build intelligent workflows in hours using framewor...

🏷️ argocd, containerization, microservices, deployment, automation

We are at an inflection point in enterprise IT. For the last decade, &ldquo;modernization&rdquo; has been synonymous with containerization &mdash; essentially packaging applications so they can run anywhere. But the goalposts have moved. The challenge is no longer just about running static microservices; it is about preparing for an era of Agentic AI and dynamic, resource-hungry workloads that defy traditional infrastructure planning. This isn&rsquo;t just a technical pivot; it&rsquo;s a surviva...

If you&rsquo;re familiar with building web applications in the last few years, you&rsquo;ve probably heard of WebAssembly (Wasm). And if not, you&rsquo;ll leave this article with a full understanding of this leading technology. Wasm is a binary instruction format that works alongside JavaScript. It speeds up web applications that process a high amount of data (i.e. image processing, heavy math computations, etc.). Think of it this way, if the purpose of the site is something that would be better...

The biggest obstacle to shipping AI agents in the enterprise isn&rsquo;t model quality. It&rsquo;s trust. Or at least that&rsquo;s the argument VAST Data is making this week at its first VAST Forward user conference here in Salt Lake City. The company may not be a household name yet, but it has quietly grown into one of the fastest-scaling players in data and AI infrastructure. Its more than 700 customers include some of the best-known hosting services, frontier AI labs, unicorn startups, and ne...
