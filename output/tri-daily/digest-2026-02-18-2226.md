🏷️ devops, cloud, reliability, aws

AI is drowning codebases in machine-written output, but without a strategic framework, we aren&rsquo;t just innovating; we&rsquo;re automating the creation of legacy mess, one enterprise software leader argues. With vibe coding, a developer&nbsp;only needs to type a few prompts into an&nbsp;AI coding assistant to&nbsp;create a functioning app in seconds. But if you repeat that process thousands of times across an engineering organization, all that AI-generated code could mean that today&rsquo;s ...

On-call work is a fact of life for IT operations (ITOps) teams, but as systems complexity and business pressure mount, burnout can quickly spread across teams. When absences increase colleagues&rsquo; workload, reduce capacity, and cause cognitive impairment, they inevitably slow incident management workflows. The good news is that it doesn&rsquo;t need to be this way. &ldquo;By carefully balancing resilience, reliability, and clarity with employee well-being, it&rsquo;s possible to create on-ca...

🏷️ security, github, docker

The Docker run command is a great introduction to running containers. It&rsquo;s simple, it&rsquo;s quick, and it&rsquo;s fairly easy to learn. It&rsquo;s also a bit limiting. For one thing, those run commands can grow quite long, and just viewing them in your terminal window can be a real challenge. As well, it&rsquo;s harder to edit those commands before running them. You might want to alter the port, which means you&rsquo;ll need to use your keyboard arrow keys to navigate back, one character...

### ArgoCD v3.3.1

**Repository:** argoproj/argo-cd | **Date:** 2026-02-18 12:30 | **Assets:** 11

[View Release](https://github.com/argoproj/argo-cd/releases/tag/v3.3.1)

#### 📌 Key Highlights

🚨 **Breaking Changes:**
- > https://argo-cd.readthedocs.io/en/stable/operator-manual/upgrading/3.2-3.3/#breaking-changes

✨ **New Features:**
- > A temporary remediation is to additionally set the `ClientSideApplyMigration=false` sync option on this Application. This solution is temporary and not recommended for the long run because it may result in conflicts between Argo CD K8s field manager and other field managers at a later point in time, and if you use it, you will need to remove it after the above issue is fixed.
