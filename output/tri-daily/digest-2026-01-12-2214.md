The OpenCost project has had a fruitful year in terms of releases, our wonderful mentees and contributors, and fun gatherings at KubeCons. If you’re new to OpenCost, it is an open-source cost and resources management tool that is an Incubating project in the Cloud Native Computing Foundation (CNCF). It was created by IBM Kubecost and continues to be maintained and supported by IBM Kubecost, Randoli, and a wider community of partners, including the major cloud providers. OpenCost releases The Ope...

### [Hybrid cloud, explained: What it is, what it isn’t, and why having a plan matters in 2026](https://www.hashicorp.com/blog/hybrid-cloud-explained-what-it-is-what-it-isn-t-and-why-having-a-plan-matters)

🏷️ cloud, security, reliability, automation, infrastructure

The mandate to leverage data and AI for operational gain is forcing businesses to reckon with growing complexity in their IT infrastructure. As a result, leaders are now asking: What is hybrid cloud, and what role will it play in our company’s future? Increasingly, companies rely on a mix of public and private cloud infrastructure services, as well as systems they own and operate themselves. Done right, this hybrid architecture lets organizations connect on-premises solutions that still support ...

### [The AI Verification Bottleneck: Developer Toil Isn’t Shrinking](https://thenewstack.io/the-ai-verification-bottleneck-developer-toil-isnt-shrinking/)

**Source:** The New Stack | **Author:** Anirban Chatterjee | **Date:** 2026-01-12 22:00 | **Reading Time:** ~5 min

🏷️ security, reliability

The first few years of generative AI in software development felt like a series of increasingly impressive magic tricks. We asked complex questions and seemingly perfect code appeared in an instant. That wide-eyed wonder and early success has morphed into an industry standard: 72% of developers who have tried AI coding tools now use them every day, according to Sonar&rsquo;s latest &ldquo;State of Code Developer Survey&rdquo; report. AI is no longer a tool for side projects; it is a primary driv...

### [A Field Guide to 2026 Federal, State and EU AI Laws](https://thenewstack.io/a-field-guide-to-2026-federal-state-and-eu-ai-laws/)

**Source:** The New Stack | **Author:** Ian Webster | **Date:** 2026-01-12 21:00 | **Reading Time:** ~12 min

🏷️ security, infrastructure, github, aws, deployment

If you ship AI applications, you have probably noticed that the questions are changing. Enterprise security questionnaires now include AI-specific sections. Requests for proposals (RFPs) require model cards and evaluation reports that didn&rsquo;t exist six months ago. Procurement teams expect documentation about system behavior and evidence that you have actually tested the system behavior. Federal large language model (LLM) procurement requirements will land in March, and EU high-risk AI oblig...

### [Map Your API Landscape To Prevent Agentic AI Disaster](https://thenewstack.io/map-your-api-landscape-to-prevent-agentic-ai-disaster/)

**Source:** The New Stack | **Author:** Charles Humble | **Date:** 2026-01-12 20:00 | **Reading Time:** ~8 min

🏷️ github, security

For over 15 years, Kin Lane, co-founder and chief community officer (CCO) for open source API foundation Naftiko, has been building his expertise in APIs &mdash; not only the technical details but also the business angle. He believes that the growing use of copilots and agentic AI systems in enterprises means we must design and build APIs around business capabilities rather than resources. APIs should represent core business functions like &ldquo;manage inventory&rdquo; or &rdquo;process payment...

### [The Weekend Our Pipeline Processed the Same Data 47 Times](https://thenewstack.io/the-weekend-our-pipeline-processed-the-same-data-47-times/)

**Source:** The New Stack | **Author:** Pradeep Kalluri | **Date:** 2026-01-12 19:00 | **Reading Time:** ~5 min

🏷️ pipeline, monitoring

It was Monday morning when our analytics team started noticing something wrong. Customer transaction volumes had apparently skyrocketed over the weekend, up 4,700% according to the dashboards. Impossible numbers were everywhere. Our fraud detection system was flagging thousands of suspicious patterns. The executive team was already asking questions. I pulled up the logs with a sinking feeling. Sure enough, our production data pipeline had processed Saturday&rsquo;s&nbsp;data not once, not twice,...

### [Forks, Clouds and the New Economics of Open Source Licensing](https://thenewstack.io/forks-clouds-and-the-new-economics-of-open-source-licensing/)

**Source:** The New Stack | **Author:** Tobie Morgan Hitchcock | **Date:** 2026-01-12 18:49 | **Reading Time:** ~9 min

🏷️ azure, observability, cloud, security, terraform

When HashiCorp changed the licenses of Terraform and many of its other products from open source MPL 2.0 to the Business Source License (BSL), the backlash was intense. So intense that the community forked Terraform to create OpenTofu under a fully open source license. OpenTofu continues to gain ground, and HashiCorp (part of IBM since February 2024) has shown signs of stabilization, but the echoes of resistance still ring through the technology industry today. What this, and other high-profile ...

### [How To Use LLMs for Continuous, Creative Code Refactoring](https://thenewstack.io/how-to-use-llms-for-continuous-creative-code-refactoring/)

**Source:** The New Stack | **Author:** Jon Udell | **Date:** 2026-01-12 18:00 | **Reading Time:** ~6 min

🏷️ aws, cloud

Refactoring used to be limited to a fixed set of transforms hardwired into IDEs. If the one you needed wasn&rsquo;t included, you were out of luck and had to do it the hard way. AI-assisted IDEs with Model Context Protocol (MCP) tool support have changed that game. Show them before and after examples of a wide variety of patterns, and they can figure out all kinds of transforms without explicit support for them. For example, here is a prompt I&rsquo;m using to clean up XMLUI apps that make unnec...

### [How To Scale GitOps Without Hitting the ‘Argo Ceiling’](https://thenewstack.io/how-to-scale-gitops-without-hitting-the-argo-ceiling/)

**Source:** The New Stack | **Author:** Vicki Walker | **Date:** 2026-01-12 17:00 | **Reading Time:** ~2 min

🏷️ security, devops, gitops, kubernetes, ci/cd

Too often, GitOps becomes a victim of its own success. One cluster and one Argo CD instance quickly sprawl into 50 clusters and 50 Argo instances, held together by glue code and custom scripts. The isolation that made Argo CD secure in the first place translates into poor visibility and uncontrolled governance. Broken processes require your team to maintain custom dashboards and brittle orchestration scripts, wasting precious engineering hours that could be spent on more important projects. What...

### [New Mobile SDK Brings Low-Code Development to On-Device AI](https://thenewstack.io/datasapiens-sdk-the-low-code-way-to-build-on-device-ai/)

**Source:** The New Stack | **Author:** Richard MacManus | **Date:** 2026-01-12 14:00 | **Reading Time:** ~6 min

One of the big AI development trends of last year was the shift to on-device inference, in many cases using so-called small language models (SLMs). Google is leading the charge on this, with its &ldquo;Web AI&rdquo; initiative and technology such as LiteRT.js, its Web AI runtime. But this trend toward processing inference on the user&rsquo;s device isn&rsquo;t just browser-based. Last month, a company called DataSapien launched a software development kit (SDK) for mobile development of on-device...
