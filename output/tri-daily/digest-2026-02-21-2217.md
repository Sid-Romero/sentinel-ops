### [Why Kubernetes 1.35 is a game-changer for stateful workload scaling](https://thenewstack.io/kubernetes-vpa-inplace-resize/)

**Source:** The New Stack | **Author:** Janakiram MSV | **Date:** 2026-02-21 16:00 | **Reading Time:** ~6 min

🏷️ deployment, github, kubernetes

With Kubernetes 1.35, the In-Place Pod Resize feature has graduated to GA, and Vertical Pod Autoscaling InPlaceOrRecreate update mode has graduated to beta.

### [Beyond the vibe code: The steep mountain MCP must climb to reach production](https://thenewstack.io/model-context-protocol-evolution/)

**Source:** The New Stack | **Author:** David Eastman | **Date:** 2026-02-21 14:00 | **Reading Time:** ~5 min
