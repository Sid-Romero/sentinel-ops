🏷️ cloud, github, infrastructure, security, observability

We’re pleased to share that the Cloud Native Computing Foundation (CNCF) has once again been selected as a mentoring organization for the 2026 edition of Google Summer of Code (GSoC). Our first selection was back in 2017, and we have been supporting and mentoring cloud native technologists ever since.&nbsp; What is GSoC? Google Summer of Code is a global program that introduces new contributors to open source communities through structured, mentored projects. Each year, selected participants wor...

### [Docker Model Runner Brings vLLM to macOS with Apple Silicon](https://www.docker.com/blog/docker-model-runner-vllm-metal-macos/)

**Source:** Docker Blog | **Author:** Yiwen Xu | **Date:** 2026-02-26 14:42 | **Reading Time:** ~6 min

🏷️ docker, github

vLLM has quickly become the go-to inference engine for developers who need high-throughput LLM serving. We brought vLLM to Docker Model Runner for NVIDIA GPUs on Linux, then extended it to Windows via WSL2. That changes today. Docker Model Runner now supports vllm-metal, a new backend that brings vLLM inference to macOS using Apple Silicon&#8217;s Metal GPU. If you have a Mac with an M-series chip, you can now run MLX models through vLLM with the same OpenAI-compatible API, same Anthropic-compat...

### [I Learned Traffic Optimization Before I Learned Cloud Computing. It Turns Out the Lessons Were the Same.](https://devops.com/i-learned-traffic-optimization-before-i-learned-cloud-computing-it-turns-out-the-lessons-were-the-same/)

**Source:** DevOps.com | **Author:** Harshit Omar | **Date:** 2026-02-27 08:57 | **Reading Time:** ~1 min

🏷️ cloud

I wanted to be a race car driver before I knew what a data center was. I started in traffic, not in the cloud. This was not a childhood dream driven by glamour. It was more practical than that. I grew up in India, and I was always late for school. Not entirely my fault. [&#8230;]

### [From vibes to engineering: How AI agents outgrew their own terminology](https://thenewstack.io/vibe-coding-agentic-engineering/)

**Source:** The New Stack | **Author:** Darryl K. Taft | **Date:** 2026-02-26 20:12 | **Reading Time:** ~8 min

🏷️ cloud, infrastructure, security, observability

Andrej Karpathy probably didn&rsquo;t set out to retire &ldquo;vibe coding&rdquo; just a year after popularizing it, but time and technological advancement forced his hand. The developer community is at a crossroads &mdash; clinging to a label while navigating a landscape that has evolved beyond it. Karpathy recently suggested &ldquo;agentic engineering&rdquo; as a more accurate description of where AI-assisted development has landed. A collection of tech industry voices responds here to Karpath...

### [Malicious NPM Package Gets Downloaded 50K Times Before Discovery](https://devops.com/malicious-npm-package-gets-downloaded-50k-times-before-discovery/)

**Source:** DevOps.com | **Author:** Mike Vizard | **Date:** 2026-02-26 20:01 | **Reading Time:** ~1 min

🏷️ devsecops, security

A malicious package downloaded approximately 50,000 times from a node package manager (npm) is providing an object lesson for adopting more DevSecOps best practices. Security researchers from Tenable discovered a “ambar-src” package that was first published Feb. 13 and then updated again before being discovered. It is aimed at developers building JavaScript applications on Windows, [&#8230;]

**Source:** The New Stack | **Author:** Jack Wallen | **Date:** 2026-02-26 18:00 | **Reading Time:** ~4 min

🏷️ cloud, azure, aws, gcp, ansible

Every once in a while, I come across a tool that makes me lean back and go, &ldquo;Wooo, that&rsquo;s cool!&rdquo; Well, I recently had that very thing happen after installing a monitor called Netdata. According to its site, Netdata is a &ldquo;Zero-config observability with an on-call AI partner. Per-second metrics that stay on-prem; Netdata AI investigates, explains root cause, and guides fixes in plain English.&rdquo; I had no idea what was in store for me upon completing the installation, bu...

### [The agent pull request flood is here. If you run Istio, you’re halfway to solving it.](https://thenewstack.io/ai-agents-istio-validation/)

**Source:** The New Stack | **Author:** Arjun Iyer | **Date:** 2026-02-26 18:00 | **Reading Time:** ~8 min

🏷️ cloud, microservices, pipeline, docker, infrastructure

Agentic workflows are rapidly accelerating the volume of pull requests, and validation is quickly becoming the most critical bottleneck. Teams using service meshes like Istio are well-positioned to solve it in ephemeral environments. Engineering teams across the industry are waking up to a harsh new reality. The widespread adoption of agentic workflows has made code generation cheap and fast, but it has created a new infrastructure problem. In simpler application architectures, running unit test...

### [Google’s Nano Banana 2 promises Flash speeds with Pro results](https://thenewstack.io/nano-banana-2/)

**Source:** The New Stack | **Author:** Frederic Lardinois | **Date:** 2026-02-26 17:05 | **Reading Time:** ~3 min

Google on Thursday launched the latest version of its Nano Banana image generation model, which promises to improve upon last November&rsquo;s Nano Banana Pro and the older Nano Banana 1 in almost every aspect, especially speed. Nano Banana&rsquo;s official name is Gemini 3.1 Flash Image, and the &lsquo;Flash&rsquo; in there gives away its pedigree. Google&rsquo;s Flash models have always focused on speed over raw intelligence, but for Nano Banana 2, the company is also bringing many features fr...

### [Observability platform migration guide: Prometheus, OpenTelemetry, and Fluent Bit](https://thenewstack.io/observability-platform-migration-guide/)

**Source:** The New Stack | **Author:** Katie Greenley | **Date:** 2026-02-26 15:28 | **Reading Time:** ~9 min

🏷️ cloud, sre, pipeline, reliability, infrastructure

Observability platform migrations are rarely simple. You&rsquo;re still balancing risk (don&rsquo;t break on-call), scope (don&rsquo;t try to move everything at once), and organizational change (getting teams to validate and adopt new workflows). The goal of this post is to share the common patterns that make it manageable when you&rsquo;re ready to undertake it using open standards instrumentation. We&rsquo;ll focus on migrations where metrics, traces, and logs already flow through open-source ...
