🏷️ docker, microservices, observability

Imagine you are running a bunch of microservices, each living within its own boundary. What are some of the challenges that come into mind when operating them? Retries: Service-to-service calls are not always reliable. They can fail due to a number of reasons, ranging from timeouts to transient network issues, or downstream outages. In order to recover, it is common for applications to implement retry logic. Over time, this logic becomes tightly coupled with business code, and every developer is...

🏷️ automation, cloud, security, monitoring, ci/cd

The banking industry spends about $600B a year on technology, investing heavily in cloud, automation, and digital services.

**Source:** The New Stack | **Author:** B. Cameron Gain | **Date:** 2026-02-04 15:26 | **Reading Time:** ~3 min

🏷️ infrastructure

ClickHouse&rsquo;s decision to shift parts of its codebase to Rust is a perfect storm: the convergence of a wildly popular database and a language riding a massive wave of momentum. While ClickHouse has earned its adoption for good reason, Rust&rsquo;s momentum as a beautiful, modern programming language arguably deserves its explosive growth and its emergence as a language of choice &mdash; not just for ClickHouse in this case, but across many projects, including parts of the Linux kernel, repl...
