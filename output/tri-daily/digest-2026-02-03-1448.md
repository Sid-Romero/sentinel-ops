### [The Problem’s Not Your Monitoring Tools, It’s Your Workflow](https://devops.com/the-problems-not-your-monitoring-tools-its-your-workflow/)

**Source:** DevOps.com | **Author:** Dan Roy | **Date:** 2026-02-03 09:52 | **Reading Time:** ~1 min

🏷️ observability, monitoring

The real cost of poor observability isn’t just downtime; it’s lost trust, wasted engineering hours, and the strain of constant firefighting. But most teams are still working across fragmented monitoring tools, juggling endless alerts, dashboards, and escalation systems that barely talk to one another, which acts like chaos disguised as control. The result is alert [&#8230;]

🏷️ kubernetes, devops

Launched in 2008, the audio streaming platform Spotify has more than 200 million active users worldwide. Initially, Spotify relied on a homegrown container orchestration system called Helios. In 2017, this became a bottleneck, and the IT team implemented Kubernetes, which increased speed while reducing costs. With Kubernetes, the Spotify backend team can develop new services [&#8230;]

### [Durable Execution: Build reliable software in an unreliable world](https://thenewstack.io/temporal-durable-execution-platform/)

**Source:** The New Stack | **Author:** Charles Humble | **Date:** 2026-02-02 23:23 | **Reading Time:** ~11 min

🏷️ cloud, deployment, reliability, aws, security

Software reliability is a persistent problem for developers because IT systems are built on unreliable components: hardware degrades; software has bugs; networks drop packets; large language models (LLMs) hallucinate; power fails. An executing program runs to completion unless: A. The program or OS encounters a bug B. An external failure, such as a machine losing power or rebooting, occurs C. There&rsquo;s a hardware failure Here&rsquo;s a small example that illustrates the problem. As I&rsquo;m...

### [Unlocking AI’s full potential: Why context is everything](https://thenewstack.io/context-is-everything-sales-force-data-360/)

**Source:** The New Stack | **Author:** Rahul Auradkar | **Date:** 2026-02-02 22:31 | **Reading Time:** ~4 min

🏷️ infrastructure, cloud

AI is ubiquitous in both the consumer and enterprise sectors. Yet few organizations are realizing AI&rsquo;s full potential. Why? AI agents must make decisions and take actions based on a limited subset of overall data. Result: too much guesswork, the occasional hallucination, and failure to extract full value from AI. The downfall of enterprise AI, then, is agents that falter without a comprehensive understanding of data, both customer- and business-derived. Companies need to be able to pivot f...

**Source:** The New Stack | **Author:** Frederic Lardinois | **Date:** 2026-02-02 20:52 | **Reading Time:** ~3 min

🏷️ github

OpenAI is betting that coding agents are outgrowing the terminal. The company launched&nbsp;a macOS desktop app on Monday for its&nbsp;Codex software development agent, which&nbsp;focuses less on the code itself and more on managing multiple software development agents in parallel. Until now, the main way to interact with Codex was through the terminal, similar to Anthropic&rsquo;s Claude Code or Google&rsquo;s Gemini CLI. While the new desktop app still allows developers to drop into an IDE lik...

A survey of 418 DevOps professionals finds that while DevOps teams closely monitor and observe the performance of applications, not nearly as many are able to correlate the value of those efforts to the business. Conducted by Catchpoint, a unit of LogicMonitor, the survey finds more than two-thirds (67%) believe application degradations are either always [&#8230;]

AI unsurprisingly took center stage during the keynotes and throughout much of&nbsp;Dynatrace Perform 2026, the annual user conference last week in Vegas.&nbsp;But while AI now&nbsp;plays a profound role in&nbsp;DevOps, platform engineering, and IT in general, its role in observability is rapidly becoming critical for those who monitor systems and take action based on&nbsp;AI-augmented observability data. In Dynatrace&rsquo;s case, with the release of Dynatrace Intelligence, the company takes a ...
