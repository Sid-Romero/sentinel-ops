### [Getting DNS Right: Principles for Effective Monitoring](https://thenewstack.io/getting-dns-right-principles-for-effective-monitoring/)

**Source:** The New Stack | **Author:** Denton Chikura | **Date:** 2025-12-31 14:00 | **Reading Time:** ~7 min

🏷️ deployment, infrastructure, cloud, monitoring, security

This is the second of two parts. Read Part 1: How to Get DNS Right: A Guide to Common Failure Modes Monitoring DNS is not simply a matter of checking whether a record resolves. A comprehensive approach follows four key principles: Test from multiple networks and regions to avoid blind spots. Validate both correctness and speed, since slow answers can harm user flows even when technically valid. Measure continuously, not periodically, because many issues manifest as short-lived or regionalized in...

### [Best of 2025: The DevOps Bottleneck: Why IaC Orchestration is the Missing Piece](https://devops.com/the-devops-bottleneck-why-iac-orchestration-is-the-missing-piece-2/)

🏷️ infrastructure, devops, security, automation, reliability

If you work in DevOps, you’ve heard it a thousand times: “Do more with less.” More automation, more security, more reliability—but with the same (or fewer) people. Meanwhile, your development teams keep growing, pushing out new features at breakneck speed. Yet somehow, the infrastructure team is supposed to scale magically to keep up. Let’s be [&#8230;]

### [Run Real Python in Browsers With Pyodide and WebAssembly](https://thenewstack.io/run-real-python-in-browsers-with-pyodide-and-webassembly/)

**Source:** The New Stack | **Author:** Jessica Wachtel | **Date:** 2025-12-30 23:30 | **Reading Time:** ~5 min

There are many ways to bring Python to the browser (thanks, WebAssembly). But there&rsquo;s only one way to bring Python&rsquo;s full functionality (really no compromises) to the browser: Pyodide. Pyodide is a full Python runtime compiled to WebAssembly that allows you to run standard Python code directly in the browser. Yes, other tools exist, but the functionality has more limits than with Pyodide. Pyodide is powerful because it&rsquo;s a port of the CPython interpreter to WebAssembly (Wasm). ...

🏷️ cloud, kubernetes, observability, prometheus

Ari Zilka says he counted 23 different observability vendors at KubeCon + CloudNativeCon&nbsp; North America 2025, and talked with every single one. According to Zilka, first-ever Hortonworks CPO and now founder of MyDecisive.ai, they&rsquo;re all showing customers essentially the same thing. &ldquo;Every observability vendor here at KubeCon is showing you a dashboard that has a magical red piece of text on it, like that&rsquo;s the broken thing,&rdquo; Zilka told The New Stack. &ldquo;Only, exc...

### [Stop Drowning in Alerts: Why Signals Are Your Team’s Lifeline](https://thenewstack.io/stop-drowning-in-alerts-why-signals-are-your-teams-lifeline/)

**Source:** The New Stack | **Author:** Ari Stowe | **Date:** 2025-12-30 18:00 | **Reading Time:** ~5 min

🏷️ pipeline, infrastructure, observability, automation

Engineering teams have done everything they can to keep up with contemporary IT systems. They&rsquo;ve added dashboards while also adopting observability platforms, building custom instrumentation and spinning intricate webs of alert rules. And yet, despite all of that labor, the message I hear most often is the same: &ldquo;We&rsquo;re drowning in alerts, but thirsting for insight.&rdquo; This is not for lack of effort. Teams have invested heavily in visibility; the problem is that visibility a...

### [Why Developers Are Ditching Frameworks for Vanilla JavaScript](https://thenewstack.io/why-developers-are-ditching-frameworks-for-vanilla-javascript/)

**Source:** The New Stack | **Author:** Alexander T. Williams | **Date:** 2025-12-30 16:00 | **Reading Time:** ~6 min

🏷️ github, pipeline, security, devops

Everyone&rsquo;s tired, and framework fatigue isn&rsquo;t just a meme anymore: It&rsquo;s a collective burnout. Developers who once raced to master React, Vue and Svelte are now quietly returning to the simplicity they left behind: Vanilla JavaScript. The web&rsquo;s pendulum is swinging back towards minimalism. The rise of native browser APIs, performance-conscious development and the AI-assisted coding wave have made plain JavaScript not only viable again, but also liberating. It&rsquo;s the h...

**Source:** The New Stack | **Author:** Loraine Lawson | **Date:** 2025-12-30 15:00 | **Reading Time:** ~6 min

🏷️ cloud

When we closed the door on 2024, there was both pearl-clutching and hype over AI &mdash; but at that time, not a lot of functionality for the frontend.&nbsp;That rapidly shifted in 2025, as AI use in web development evolved from code production into the creation of systems-aware components and plugins. This year also saw developers move past the generic chatbot era to an approach that bakes AI directly into the frontend architecture, via a new category of generative tools that better understand ...

### [Kubernetes v1.35: Watch Based Route Reconciliation in the Cloud Controller Manager](https://kubernetes.io/blog/2025/12/30/kubernetes-v1-35-watch-based-route-reconciliation-in-ccm/)

**Source:** Kubernetes Blog | **Date:** 2025-12-30 18:30 | **Reading Time:** ~1 min

🏷️ cloud, kubernetes, sre

Up to and including Kubernetes v1.34, the route controller in Cloud Controller Manager (CCM) implementations built using the k8s.io/cloud-provider library reconciles routes at a fixed interval. This causes unnecessary API requests to the cloud provider when there are no changes to routes. Other controllers implemented through the same library already use watch-based mechanisms, leveraging informers to avoid unnecessary API calls. A new feature gate is being introduced in v1.35 to allow changing ...
