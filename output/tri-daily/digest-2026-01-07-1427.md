### [HolmesGPT: Agentic troubleshooting built for the cloud native era](https://www.cncf.io/blog/2026/01/07/holmesgpt-agentic-troubleshooting-built-for-the-cloud-native-era/)

**Source:** CNCF Blog | **Author:** Aritra Ghosh (Senior PM, Microsoft) and Natan Yellin (CEO & Co-Founder, Robusta.dev) | **Date:** 2026-01-07 12:00 | **Reading Time:** ~4 min

🏷️ pipeline, prometheus, kubernetes, grafana, deployment

If you’ve ever debugged a production incident, you know that the hardest part often isn’t the fix, it’s finding where to begin. Most on-call engineers end up spending hours piecing together clues, fighting time pressure, and trying to make sense of scattered data. You’ve probably run into one or more of these challenges:&nbsp; Unwritten knowledge and missing context:You’re pulled into an outage for a service you barely know. The original owners have changed teams, the documentation is half-writt...

### [Deterministic AI Testing with Session Recording in cagent](https://www.docker.com/blog/deterministic-ai-testing-with-session-recording-in-cagent/)

**Source:** Docker Blog | **Author:** Srini Sekaran | **Date:** 2026-01-06 19:16 | **Reading Time:** ~2 min

🏷️ github, security, ci/cd, docker

AI agents introduce a challenge that traditional software doesn’t have: non-determinism. The same prompt can produce different outputs across runs, making reliable testing difficult. Add API costs and latency to the mix, and developer productivity takes a hit. Session recording in cagent addresses this directly. Record an AI interaction once, replay it indefinitely—with identical results, zero API costs, and millisecond execution times. How session recording works cagent implements the VCR patte...

### [From Automation to Autonomy: What AIOps Actually Looks Like Today](https://devops.com/from-automation-to-autonomy-what-aiops-actually-looks-like-today/)

**Source:** DevOps.com | **Author:** Ankush Dhar | **Date:** 2026-01-07 11:23 | **Reading Time:** ~1 min

🏷️ devops, pipeline, automation, ci/cd

For years, engineering leaders have been promised that automation would shrink operational work. CI/CD pipelines, runbooks, chatbots and DevOps tooling were supposed to mean reduced tickets, fewer incidents and fewer 3 a.m. pages. Instead, operational load has exploded. Systems are more distributed, dependencies are more tangled and customer expectations are less forgiving. What’s changed recently [&#8230;]

🏷️ observability, monitoring

A survey of 100 VP+ IT decision-makers published today finds 62% plan to increase spending on observability initiatives over the next 12 to 24 months, with only 4% planning to decrease spending. Conducted by LogicMonitor, a provider of a monitoring and observability platform, the survey also finds more than two-thirds (67%) are very likely or [&#8230;]

### [Fewer Wires, More Qubits: D-Wave Tackles Quantum Computing’s Cable Problem](https://thenewstack.io/fewer-wires-more-qubits-d-wave-tackles-quantum-computings-cable-problem/)

**Source:** The New Stack | **Author:** Frederic Lardinois | **Date:** 2026-01-06 21:00 | **Reading Time:** ~4 min

Quantum computing pioneer D-Wave today announced an industry breakthrough in its approach to building and controlling its upcoming gate model quantum computer. One issue that the quantum computing industry is focused on right now &mdash; besides the perpetual question of how to best perform the necessary error corrections to run commercially viable algorithms on these machines &mdash; is how to connect the quantum computing unit to the classical machines that control it. Why Cables Are a Problem...

### [What It Takes To Scale AI Agents in Production](https://thenewstack.io/what-it-takes-to-scale-ai-agents-in-production/)

**Source:** The New Stack | **Author:** Raj Shukla | **Date:** 2026-01-06 20:00 | **Reading Time:** ~8 min

🏷️ microservices, pipeline, infrastructure, ci/cd

With the release of &ldquo;reasoning&rdquo; models capable of multistep, test-time compute, the intelligence required to solve complex problems is accessible via a standard API. For the enterprise technical leader, this looks like progress. But it introduces a massive, hidden scalability ceiling. The trap is relying on the large language model (LLM) to act as its own middleware. Teams often expose existing API endpoints, which were built for a strict contract for microservices and not for LLMs a...

### [From Pets to Cattle: The New Mindset for Managing VMs](https://thenewstack.io/from-pets-to-cattle-the-new-mindset-for-managing-vms/)

### [Serverless Cloud Architecture Is Failing Modern AI Agents](https://thenewstack.io/serverless-cloud-architecture-is-failing-modern-ai-agents/)

**Source:** The New Stack | **Author:** Abigail Wall | **Date:** 2026-01-06 18:00 | **Reading Time:** ~5 min

🏷️ microservices, pipeline, aws, automation, reliability

For nearly a decade, cloud architecture has been shaped by a simple rule: Keep everything stateless. AWS Lambda and other serverless platforms encouraged teams to carve workloads into tiny, short-lived functions with no persistent state and minimal local resources. This model scaled well, was cost-efficient and became the backbone of modern microservices. By 2025, AI agents were pushed directly into production across sectors such as finance, healthcare, energy, e-commerce and software developmen...

### [The Hidden Engineering Cost of ‘AI Everywhere’ Product Roadmaps](https://thenewstack.io/the-hidden-engineering-cost-of-ai-everywhere-product-roadmaps/)

**Source:** The New Stack | **Author:** Alexander T. Williams | **Date:** 2026-01-06 17:00 | **Reading Time:** ~6 min

🏷️ pipeline, reliability, observability, infrastructure, monitoring

AI has quietly shifted from a differentiator to a default expectation. Product roadmaps now arrive with &ldquo;AI-powered&rdquo; stamped on nearly every feature, whether it makes sense or not. Teams rarely ask if AI is the right tool; they ask how fast it can be added. That mindset feels strategic on the surface, but it carries a hidden engineering tax that compounds over time. Sadly, it&rsquo;s the dev teams that absorb this cost first. Infrastructure expands, complexity multiplies, and reliabi...

### [How Small Engineering Teams Can Improve Reliability Without Adding Process Overhead](https://devops.com/how-small-engineering-teams-can-improve-reliability-without-adding-process-overhead/)

🏷️ reliability

Modern software teams are under constant pressure to ship faster while maintaining reliability. For small engineering teams, this balance can feel especially difficult. Limited resources, tight deadlines, and shared responsibilities often mean that reliability improvements are postponed in favor of feature delivery. The good news is that improving reliability does not require heavy frameworks, additional [&#8230;]

🏷️ kubernetes, docker, observability, gcp, infrastructure

Did Kubernetes break up Amazon Web Services cloud party? As the co-founder and CTO of cloud native hardware company Oxide Computer Company, Bryan Cantrill isn&rsquo;t one to shy away from speaking his mind. In a recent wide-ranging interview on the &nbsp;Pragmatic Engineer&nbsp;podcast, hosted by&nbsp;Gergely Orosz,&nbsp; he offered a perspective on how the release of Kubernetes was essential for fueling the growth of the Google Cloud Platform and other nascent cloud providers, when AWS was rele...

Building on continual partnership work with the chip company, Red Hat has pledged to offer &ldquo;Day 0&rdquo; support for Nvidia&rsquo;s newly-announced Vera Rubin Platform, when it arrives later this year. The enterprise open source software company is aiming to close the release gap between the launch of Nvidia&rsquo;s hardware platform and the general availability release of its own supporting stack of software, a custom version of its flagship operating system, Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHE...
