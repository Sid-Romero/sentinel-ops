### [State of cloud native 2026: CNCF CTO’s insights and predictions](https://www.cncf.io/blog/2026/02/19/state-of-cloud-native-2026-cncf-ctos-insights-and-predictions/)

🏷️ cloud, aws, observability, security, kubernetes

We’ve just celebrated the 10th anniversary of the Cloud Native Computing Foundation (CNCF), the foundation behind Kubernetes and so many other successful open source projects we all rely on. That alone was a good reason to sit down with Chris Aniszczyk, the CTO and co-founder of CNCF, at the start of 2026, to discuss the state of cloud native, and find out what’s coming next. The state of the CNCF Ten years into CNCF’s journey, that sense of amazement is exactly how I feel. What began with Kuber...

### [How Medplum Secured Their Healthcare Platform with Docker Hardened Images (DHI)](https://www.docker.com/blog/medplum-healthcare-docker-hardened-images/)

**Source:** Docker Blog | **Author:** Jennifer Kohl | **Date:** 2026-02-19 14:00 | **Reading Time:** ~11 min

🏷️ github, pipeline, cloud, docker, infrastructure

Special thanks to Cody Ebberson and the Medplum team for their open-source contribution and for sharing their migration experience with the community. A real-world example of migrating a HIPAA-compliant EHR platform to DHI with minimal code changes. Healthcare software runs on trust. When patient data is at stake, security isn&#8217;t just a feature but a fundamental requirement. For healthcare platform providers, proving that trust to enterprise customers is an ongoing challenge that requires c...

### [Saving banks from technical debt: How Atruvia built secure, self-service infrastructure](https://www.hashicorp.com/blog/saving-banks-from-technical-debt-how-atruvia-built-secure-self-service-infrastructure)

**Source:** HashiCorp Blog | **Author:** Maile Chaffin-Quiray | **Date:** 2026-02-19 17:00 | **Reading Time:** ~5 min

🏷️ terraform, pipeline, cloud, infrastructure, gitlab

Outdated IT systems cost financial services firms an average of $100 million annually, including $31.7 million in losses from cyber threats. For IT service providers like Atruvia — responsible for maintaining the core infrastructure behind hundreds of banks and millions of customer transactions — this reality underscores the urgency of modernization. Serving over 900 financial institutions in Germany, including Volksbank and Raiffeisenbank, Atruvia manages one of Europe’s largest financial IT ec...

### [The essential shift every ITOps leader must make to survive an unrelenting stream of incidents](https://thenewstack.io/modernizing-itops-incident-management/)

**Source:** The New Stack | **Author:** Ariel Russo | **Date:** 2026-02-19 21:46 | **Reading Time:** ~4 min

🏷️ infrastructure, automation

High-profile IT incidents are becoming more frequent and more severe. A single hour of downtime for a revenue-generating service could cost large enterprises between $100,000 and $249,999. Even that figure &mdash; from an IDC analyst brief &mdash; may be too low when accounting for customer churn and lost productivity. It also fails to consider the growing toll that incident management is taking on first responders. &ldquo;A single hour of downtime for a revenue-generating service could cost lar...

### [AI agents are accelerating vulnerability discovery. Here’s how AppSec teams must adapt.](https://thenewstack.io/ai-agents-appsec-strategy/)

**Source:** The New Stack | **Author:** Josh Lemos | **Date:** 2026-02-19 21:31 | **Reading Time:** ~4 min

🏷️ pipeline, infrastructure, gitlab, ci/cd, security

It has never been easier to quickly and at scale find security vulnerabilities. Linus&rsquo;s Law, Eric Raymond&rsquo;s famous dictum about open source software, states that &ldquo;given enough eyeballs, all bugs are shallow.&rdquo; In other words, if enough people look at a piece of code, someone will eventually spot the problems. AI has supercharged this principle, powering new tools that accelerate and expand the ability to find vulnerabilities. The question is, who will find them first: your...

### [How your LLM is silently hallucinating company revenue](https://thenewstack.io/llm-database-context-mcp/)

**Source:** The New Stack | **Author:** Alasdair Brown | **Date:** 2026-02-19 21:06 | **Reading Time:** ~7 min

🏷️ observability

LLMs are accelerating work across engineering disciplines, from generating React components and building backend APIs to noodling with SQL. But we all know LLMs make mistakes, and the nature of those mistakes varies dramatically across domains. Using LLMs with databases is deceptively error-prone. When an LLM generates a React component, errors tend to surface quickly. The code either fails to compile or renders something visibly wrong: a button in the wrong place, a modal that won&rsquo;t close...

### [Rising identity complexity: How CISOs can prevent it from becoming an attacker’s roadmap](https://thenewstack.io/ciso-identity-complexity-strategy/)

**Source:** The New Stack | **Author:** Jay Reddy | **Date:** 2026-02-19 20:47 | **Reading Time:** ~7 min

🏷️ pipeline, cloud, azure, aws, security

Identity has always been the thread that stitches enterprise IT together, but the nature of that identity has changed dramatically. Twenty years ago, identity meant a username and password sitting in a corporate directory. Access was tied to a desktop on a corporate LAN. Identities were relatively static, human, and predictable. Fast forward to today, and everything has changed. Identities aren&rsquo;t just employees; they are contractors, partners, machines, bots, APIs, cloud workloads, and Saa...

### [Google’s Gemini 3.1 Pro is mostly great](https://thenewstack.io/googles-gemini-3-1-pro-is-mostly-great/)

**Source:** The New Stack | **Author:** Frederic Lardinois | **Date:** 2026-02-19 19:46 | **Reading Time:** ~3 min

Google on Thursday launched the latest version of its Gemini Pro model. While it&rsquo;s not the best at every task, Gemini 3.1 Pro, which is officially still in preview, is far better at solving complex problems than Google&rsquo;s previous mainstream model &mdash; at least according to the benchmarks. Both Anthropic and OpenAI launched quite a few models in recent weeks. Earlier this month, Google launched Gemini 3 Deep Think, which features a specialized reasoning mode that easily outperforms...

**Source:** The New Stack | **Author:** Frederic Lardinois | **Date:** 2026-02-19 19:00 | **Reading Time:** ~4 min

🏷️ cloud, security

Over the last year or so, we&rsquo;ve seen a proliferation of frameworks and protocols for agentic AI tools. There is Agent-2-Agent (A2A) for agents to talk to each other, the Agentic Commerce Protocol (ACP) and Agent Payments Protocol (AP2) for agents to talk to commerce systems, and, of course, the Model Context Protocol (MCP) for agents to talk to tools and bring in context. There&rsquo;s no end to the acronyms. What&rsquo;s missing in all of this, however, is a framework that helps agents co...

### [Prometheus and OpenTelemetry finally play nice](https://thenewstack.io/prometheus-and-opentelemetry-love-each-other-more-than-in-the-past/)

**Source:** The New Stack | **Author:** B. Cameron Gain | **Date:** 2026-02-19 18:00 | **Reading Time:** ~3 min

🏷️ prometheus, grafana, observability, deployment, kubernetes

The often-misunderstood controversies regarding Prometheus and OpenTelemetry arise more from technical incompatibilities that have since been resolved. Without going into the history of those controversies, it can be said that Prometheus remains the gold standard for metrics from Kubernetes deployments. OpenTelemetry acts as a conduit to Prometheus, complementing it with distributed traces and, more recently, logs. While OpenTelemetry primarily offers a push-based approach, Prometheus can contin...

### [Anthropic: You can still use your Claude accounts to run OpenClaw, NanoClaw and Co.](https://thenewstack.io/anthropic-agent-sdk-confusion/)

**Source:** The New Stack | **Author:** Frederic Lardinois | **Date:** 2026-02-18 23:53 | **Reading Time:** ~3 min

OpenClaw, NanoClaw, and the various other personal AI agents that are all the hype right now can quickly burn through millions of AI tokens. What has made them affordable is that even the most basic plans at a flat rate of $20/month from Anthropic or OpenAI allow you to use their coding agents with relatively generous token limits, all without using a pay-as-you-go API key. However, Anthropic recently updated its Claude Code documentation to note that using the OAuth token from those accounts in...
