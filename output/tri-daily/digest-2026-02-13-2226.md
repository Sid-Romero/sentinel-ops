### [How to solve the context size issues with context packing with Docker Model Runner and Agentic Compose](https://www.docker.com/blog/context-packing-context-window/)

**Source:** Docker Blog | **Author:** Yiwen Xu | **Date:** 2026-02-13 13:57 | **Reading Time:** ~8 min

🏷️ helm, docker

If you’ve worked with local language models, you’ve probably run into the context window limit, especially when using smaller models on less powerful machines. While it’s an unavoidable constraint, techniques like context packing make it surprisingly manageable. Hello, I’m Philippe, and I am a Principal Solutions Architect helping customers with their usage of Docker. In my previous blog post, I wrote about how to make a very small model useful by using RAG. I had limited the message history to ...

🏷️ deployment, azure, aws, security

HashiCorp Vault users need to have continuous answers to questions like: What secrets and certificates do we have? What do we know about them? Do any of them require action? Typically this is done by collecting and analyzing logs, or additional visibility tools in HCP Vault Dedicated. Now, HCP Vault users have access to additional visibility and reporting capabilities with certificates and secrets inventory reporting, a new feature set now available in beta. These new dashboards visualize access...

In today’s enterprise digital landscape, mainframe modernization is no longer a back-office technical exercise. It has become a strategic initiative tied directly to innovation velocity, operational resilience, regulatory compliance and long-term competitiveness. Organizations are not abandoning the mainframe, but they are rethinking how code, architecture and platforms evolve to meet modern business demands. Techstrong polled [&#8230;]

### [GitHub’s Agentic Workflows bring “continuous AI” into the CI/CD loop](https://thenewstack.io/github-agentic-workflows-overview/)

**Source:** The New Stack | **Author:** Frederic Lardinois | **Date:** 2026-02-13 14:00 | **Reading Time:** ~5 min

🏷️ github, ci/cd, automation, security, infrastructure

A lot of the hype around agents has been around writing code, but what if you could have an agent watch for events in your GitHub repo and automatically run a set workflow when, for example, a new issue is created? And what if you could just describe the workflow to the agent, and then have it generate the detailed steps for you? That&rsquo;s the question the GitHub Next team, the same team that also incubated GitHub Copilot, asked itself. In an interview with The New Stack, Eddie Aftandilian, a...

### [Why 40% of AI projects will be canceled by 2027 (and how to stay in the other 60%)](https://thenewstack.io/agentic-ai-connectivity-platform/)

**Source:** The New Stack | **Author:** Alex Drag | **Date:** 2026-02-13 14:00 | **Reading Time:** ~8 min

🏷️ security, deployment, observability, infrastructure

The agentic AI race is on, and most organizations are at risk of losing it. Not because they lack ambition, but because they&rsquo;re fighting three wars simultaneously without a unified strategy. Looking at what separates successful agentic AI programs from the 40% that Gartner predicts will be canceled by 2027, the pattern is clear. Organizations aren&rsquo;t failing at AI. They&rsquo;re failing at the infrastructure that makes AI work at enterprise scale. There are three underlying crises of ...

🏷️ automation, reliability, sre, devops

DevOps and site reliability engineering (SRE) are complementary strategies that enhance both speed and reliability in software development. While DevOps focuses on collaboration and automation to break down silos between development and operations, SRE emphasizes engineering reliability through metrics and accountability. By integrating both approaches, organizations can foster high-quality software delivery that meets reliability standards, streamline incident response, and utilize data-driven ...

🏷️ security, helm

AI agents are all the rage in enterprises today. CEOs and CTOs want them brought into their businesses ASAP to perform a wide range of tasks that can streamline operations while boosting sales, revenue, and productivity. But building and deploying effective and laser-focused AI agents takes more than desire. It requires an enormous and reliable firehose of critical business data that provides the lifeblood for effective agentic AI development and use inside enterprises. Building and operating AI...

🏷️ github

The latest iteration of the TIOBE Index of programming languages indicates that more specialized languages are creeping up on Python&rsquo;s dominance. Although Python remains the most popular programming language, the index suggests that several more specialized languages are gradually gaining ground at Python&rsquo;s expense, most notably R and Perl. Python has maintained a lead of more than 10 percentage points over its closest competitors. In absolute terms, Python reached its peak popularit...

🏷️ security

Software teams have always lived with a built-in tension – developers push to ship fast, while security teams pump the brakes to assess risk. Now, with AI flooding the enterprise, that friction is spiking. One recent survey found a staggering 322% jump in privilege-escalation risks tied to AI-generated code. The root problem isn’t new – [&#8230;]
