### [Self-Driving DevOps? How Stakpak Tackles Infrastructure Complexity](https://thenewstack.io/self-driving-devops-how-stakpak-tackles-infrastructure-complexity/)

🏷️ deployment, automation, aws, pipeline, helm

Everything in tech is always changing at what feels like a breakneck pace &mdash; everything except DevOps infrastructure, that is. Actually, George Fahmy, co-founder and CEO at Stakpak, says managing infrastructure is getting harder &mdash; that&rsquo;s in spite of the AI wave. Or perhaps because of it? &ldquo;Since LLMs [large language models] came out&hellip; we realized that they&rsquo;re really good at coding&mdash;and most developers actually enjoy coding,&rdquo; he remarks. &ldquo;But the...

As AI increasingly permeates the software development landscape, new research from OpenAI offers sobering insights into the current limitations of even the most advanced AI coding assistants. The benchmark study, &#8220;SWE-Lancer: Can Frontier LLMs Earn $1 Million from Real-World Freelance Software Engineering?&#8221; presents evidence that despite rapid advances, today&#8217;s frontier AI models still fall short [&#8230;]

### [Goodbye Plugins: MCP Is Becoming the Universal Interface for AI](https://thenewstack.io/goodbye-plugins-mcp-is-becoming-the-universal-interface-for-ai/)

**Source:** The New Stack | **Author:** Sowjanya Pandruju | **Date:** 2025-12-28 18:00 | **Reading Time:** ~4 min

🏷️ deployment, observability, monitoring, security

Three months ago, I spent two weeks building a custom plugin to connect our AI assistant to our internal CRM system. Last week, I replaced it with a Model Context Protocol (MCP) server that took four hours to implement, and it works with every AI model in our stack. This is not just a productivity win, but a glimpse into a fundamental shift happening across the AI ecosystem. It feels like the era of fragmented plugins is ending, and MCP is emerging as the universal interface that could standardi...

### [Martin Fowler on Preparing for AI’s Nondeterministic Computing](https://thenewstack.io/martin-fowler-on-preparing-for-ais-nondeterministic-computing/)

**Source:** The New Stack | **Author:** Joab Jackson | **Date:** 2025-12-28 16:00 | **Reading Time:** ~4 min

Martin Fowler, Thoughtworks chief scientist and long-time expert on object-oriented programming, views AI as the biggest shift in programming he has seen in his entire career. In an interview on the Pragmatic Engineer podcast, hosted by Gergely Orosz, Fowler admitted about AI that, &ldquo;We&rsquo;re still learning how to do this.&rdquo; The closest parallel for the industry would be the shift away from assembly language. Assembly language was tedious to write, as much of the work involved movin...

### [CrunchBang Linux Lives on With GreenBang](https://thenewstack.io/crunchbang-linux-lives-on-with-greenbang/)

**Source:** The New Stack | **Author:** Jack Wallen | **Date:** 2025-12-28 15:00 | **Reading Time:** ~5 min

🏷️ aws

CrunchBang was a Debian-based Linux distribution that was minimal and pretty popular among hard-core users. CrunchBang eventually ended, but gave way to the likes of CrunchBang++ and even one of my favorites, BunsenLabs Linux. There was yet another spinoff of CrunchBang, ArchBang. As you can guess, this take was based on Arch Linux, but retained the Openbox window manager to keep the lightweight speed. ArchBang fell to the wayside, only to be resurrected as GreenBang. It&rsquo;s kind of confusin...
