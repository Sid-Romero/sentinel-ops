**Source:** Docker Blog | **Author:** Srini Sekaran | **Date:** 2026-02-04 02:02 | **Reading Time:** ~4 min

🏷️ security

Every time execution models change, security frameworks need to change with them. Agents force the next shift. The Unattended Laptop Problem No developer would leave their laptop unattended and unlocked. The risk is obvious. A developer laptop has root-level access to production systems, repositories, databases, credentials, and APIs. If someone sat down and started using it, they could review pull requests, modify files, commit code, and access anything the developer can access. Yet this is how...

🏷️ security, pipeline, observability, ci/cd, cloud

PCI DSS (Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard) defines technical and operational requirements for protecting payment data. Recently this standard has raised the bar for how organizations protect payment data, especially in cloud-native environments. With the release of PCI DSS 4.0, tatic credentials, hard-coded secrets, and limited visibility across development pipelines are no longer just bad practices, they are audit risks that could result in significant fines. Organizations are being...

Artificial intelligence tools are now a routine part of today’s software development, promising faster output and reduced workloads. But new research from Anthropic suggests that when developers rely on AI while learning new skills, those productivity gains may come at the expense of understanding. In a randomized controlled study involving 52 mostly junior software engineers, [&#8230;]

🏷️ cloud, security

Hysteria continues to build over Moltbook, the so-called AI Agent social network. If you believe Elon Musk, Moltbook is at the &ldquo;very early stages of the singularity,&rdquo; which is when AI outstrips human intelligence, and we&rsquo;re either on our way to Terminators or Iain Banks&rsquo; utopian The Culture. Since Musk names SpaceX retrieval ships after Culture ships, we know which way he&rsquo;s betting. Or, as Stackernerd puts it, it&rsquo;s &ldquo;a reminder that most AI &lsquo;breakth...

🏷️ security, kubernetes, aws, deployment

We warned you! Today, Ingress NGINX is still being used by 50% of Kubernetes users to manage incoming traffic, but&nbsp;it&rsquo;s long been slotted for retirement. We warned you, but did you listen? Nope. After the news was out, 44% of you were still using it, according to a Reddit survey! Wow. Seriously, are you folks gluttons for punishment? Because I hate to break it to you, but the Kubernetes Steering and Security Response Committees just announced on January 29th that &ldquo;In March 2026,...

🏷️ observability, monitoring

The real cost of poor observability isn’t just downtime; it’s lost trust, wasted engineering hours, and the strain of constant firefighting. But most teams are still working across fragmented monitoring tools, juggling endless alerts, dashboards, and escalation systems that barely talk to one another, which acts like chaos disguised as control. The result is alert [&#8230;]
