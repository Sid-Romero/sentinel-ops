The CNCF Annual Cloud Native Survey confirms a long-developing trend: Kubernetes has moved from container orchestration to becoming the backbone of modern infrastructure—including AI. Production usage of Kubernetes now stands at 82% among container users, and 66% of AI adopters are using it to scale inference workloads. Kubernetes is no longer a niche tool; it’s a core infrastructure layer supporting scale, reliability, and increasingly AI systems. This shift reflects both the technical evolutio...

New CNCF Annual Cloud Native Survey reveals near-universal adoption of Kubernetes Key highlights: The CNCF Annual Cloud Native Survey reveals that Kubernetes has solidified its role as the de facto &#8216;operating system&#8217; for AI, with 82% of container users now running it in production environments. It confirms that Kubernetes is no longer an emerging technology but the established, reliable foundation for modern enterprise infrastructure, enabling companies to confidently scale and opera...

The problem nobody talks about GPUs are expensive; and yours are probably sitting idle right now. High-end GPUs (for example, NVIDIA A100-class devices) can cost $10,000+, and in a Kubernetes cluster running AI workloads, you might have dozens of them. Here&#8217;s the uncomfortable truth: most of the time, they&#8217;re sitting idle. If you&#8217;re struggling with GPU scheduling in Kubernetes or looking for ways to reclaim idle GPUs, you&#8217;re not alone. A data scientist spins up a training...

🏷️ security

The steady buildout of vibe-coded applications into production will lead to catastrophic problems for organizations that don&rsquo;t properly review AI-developed software, a software security expert predicts. David Mytton, founder and CEO of developer security provider Arcjet, writes in a LinkedIn post: &ldquo;In 2026, I expect more and more vibe-coded applications hitting production in a big way. That&rsquo;s going to be great for velocity &hellip; but you&rsquo;ve still got to pay attention. T...

🏷️ cloud, devops, ci/cd, pipeline, reliability

For most platform engineering teams, internal developer portals are considered the best way to solve DevOps scalability challenges. The ability to instantly spin up a new pipeline by cloning a template has been a game-changer for development teams. With just the push of a button, a developer can set up a new pipeline with all the workflows, toolchains, and resources they need to create a new application. It almost feels like magic. But this Day 1 speed often comes with a major Day 2 problem: ope...

Coming off a great holiday break, full of eggnog-induced reflection and an eagerness to get this year rolling, I couldn&rsquo;t resist a quick (and slightly self-congratulatory) look back at my 2025 trend predictions. Let&rsquo;s see if I deserve a crystal ball or just a cheap plastic one. Here&rsquo;s a lightning recap of the 2025 Top Trends, just in case you haven&rsquo;t memorized them: 2025: A Look Back Generative AI will supercharge software development.

**Source:** The New Stack | **Author:** Jessica Wachtel | **Date:** 2026-01-20 17:00 | **Reading Time:** ~4 min

When we talk about WebAssembly&nbsp;(Wasm), we often describe it as &ldquo;near-native speed&rdquo; and &ldquo;faster than JavaScript.&rdquo; But what does that actually look like in practice? Before we get into where Wasm excels, let&rsquo;s level-set: JavaScript is still a developer&rsquo;s best friend when it comes to UI. It was built to manipulate the DOM (the web&rsquo;s Document Object Model) and handle CSS updates, and it does that job successfully. But we&rsquo;re watching the demands of...

🏷️ security, reliability

Before the hype around Model Context Protocol (MCP) had a chance to die down, Anthropic pulled another winner out of its hat: Agent Skills. Agents are full decision-making entities with system prompts, tool access, backing models (Claude, ChatGPT, etc.) and agentic loops that let them orchestrate workflows and manage state. The new Agent Skills are modular, declarative bundles of expertise &mdash; organized procedural knowledge packaged into reusable units that agents load progressively as neede...

🏷️ prometheus, deployment, cloud, terraform, kubernetes

Agentic AI has shifted from toy demos to the front lines of real products: autonomous research assistants, compliance copilots, ops bots that watch dashboards and file tickets, and Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) copilots wired to enterprise data. The problem is not &ldquo;can we make an agent do something clever once?&rdquo; Rather, it&rsquo;s &ldquo;can we make agents reliable, observable, cost-aware, and safe every time?&rdquo; Achieving this requires a comprehensive, production-focused ...
