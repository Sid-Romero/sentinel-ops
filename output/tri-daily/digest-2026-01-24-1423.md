### [Vercel’s json-render: A step toward generative UI](https://thenewstack.io/vercels-json-render-a-step-toward-generative-ui/)

**Source:** The New Stack | **Author:** Loraine Lawson | **Date:** 2026-01-23 21:00 | **Reading Time:** ~6 min

🏷️ cloud, aws, infrastructure

Vercel recently released a new open source tool called json-render that signals a step toward generative user interfaces (UI), a term Vercel coined for AI-generated web interfaces. &ldquo;What if, instead of just generating text, the LLM [large language model] could give us UI on the fly?&rdquo; Guillermo Rauch, the founder and CEO of Vercel, asks The New Stack. &ldquo;We&rsquo;re basically plugging the AI directly into the rendering layer.&rdquo; AI and infrastructure will soon be able to suppo...

🏷️ infrastructure, gitops, helm, reliability, ci/cd

The latest Cloud Native Computing Foundation&nbsp;(CNCF) Annual Cloud Native Survey has been released, and with &ldquo;82% of container users running Kubernetes in production, cloud native has crossed a defining threshold,&rdquo; it boasts. &ldquo;What was once experimental is now foundational.&rdquo; Or, as Chris Aniszczyk, CNCF&rsquo;s CTO, put it, &ldquo;Kubernetes is no longer a niche tool; it&rsquo;s a core infrastructure layer supporting scale, reliability, and increasingly AI systems.&rdq...

### [Futurum Group Survey Sees Increasing Investments in AI to Deliver Software](https://devops.com/futurum-group-survey-sees-increasing-investments-in-ai-to-deliver-software/)

**Source:** DevOps.com | **Author:** Mike Vizard | **Date:** 2026-01-23 18:10 | **Reading Time:** ~1 min

A global survey of 628 enterprise IT leaders conducted by the Futurum Group finds that increasing investment in generative artificial intelligence (AI) (40%), followed closely by AI and machine learning (ML) technologies (39%) and applying AI to IT operations (37%), also known as AIOps, are expected to be the top three drivers for accelerating software [&#8230;]

### [From data to dollars: AI’s role in the modern GTM stack](https://thenewstack.io/from-data-to-dollars-ais-role-in-the-modern-gtm-stack/)

**Source:** The New Stack | **Author:** Deirdre Mahon | **Date:** 2026-01-23 18:00 | **Reading Time:** ~5 min

🏷️ automation, pipeline

The discussion around AI often focuses on content creation, software development and financial management. However, one of the business processes being transformed fastest is the go-to-market (GTM) process, where marketing, sales, and product align to generate revenue. For years, the formula to acquire and upsell customers relied on the &ldquo;demand generation funnel,&rdquo; built on CRM and marketing automation tools like Salesforce or HubSpot. This process tracked customer engagement, used sc...

🏷️ devsecops, observability, microservices, monitoring, gitops

Kubernetes continues to evolve and mature as the most preferred orchestration platform for containerized applications and microservices. Kubernetes 1.35, the most recent version, released in mid-December 2025, offers several enhancements that are now generally available. These features bring reliability and efficiency to workloads running on Kubernetes clusters. This article focuses on five major enhancements that are generally available in Kubernetes 1.35. In-place pod resource updates In-place...

### [Developer proves AI agents can be reprogrammed via new exploit](https://thenewstack.io/developer-proves-ai-agents-can-be-reprogrammed-via-new-exploit/)

**Source:** The New Stack | **Author:** Loraine Lawson | **Date:** 2026-01-23 16:30 | **Reading Time:** ~3 min

🏷️ github, security

A new VS Code exploit can rewrite AI agents across all code repositories, an application security specialist demonstrated Thursday. On Wednesday, the SANS Technology Institute reported on new zero-click exploit that only requires developers open the folder in affected editors. The VS Code exploit&nbsp;involves a malicious tasks.json file that silently runs inside code editors. It was originally identified by Oasis, along with a recommended mitigation developers could apply. Within 24 hours, Isaa...

### [More security tools are slowing down your incident response](https://thenewstack.io/more-security-tools-are-slowing-down-your-incident-response/)

**Source:** The New Stack | **Author:** Raghav Iyer | **Date:** 2026-01-23 16:00 | **Reading Time:** ~6 min

🏷️ automation, infrastructure, monitoring, helm, reliability

Time plays a crucial role in an organization&rsquo;s defense posture, including the timestamping of events, whether they occurred during business or non-business hours, context, such as after a major business change or during a specific season, and the time taken to detect and respond to incidents. While most of these time-related factors lie outside security teams&rsquo; control, they&rsquo;re directly responsible for the time it takes to detect and respond to cyberattacks and impacts to the or...

### [Context is AI coding’s real bottleneck in 2026](https://thenewstack.io/context-is-ai-codings-real-bottleneck-in-2026/)

**Source:** The New Stack | **Author:** Greg Foster | **Date:** 2026-01-23 15:00 | **Reading Time:** ~4 min

🏷️ cloud, infrastructure, security

Walk into any engineering leadership meeting today, and someone will question whether AI-generated code is secure or whether agents can be trusted in production. These are valid concerns, but they don&rsquo;t determine whether your team ships faster. The bottleneck is context: the gap between what engineers carry in their heads and what AI can understand or communicate. Companies that solve the context problem will move faster. Their tools will make fewer mistakes that require human correction, ...
