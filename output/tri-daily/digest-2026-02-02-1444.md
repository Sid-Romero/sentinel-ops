For decades, distributed databases have been built around the assumption that storage will live close to compute. The farther data travels over the network, the reasoning goes, the greater the potential for delay. Local RAID (redundant array of independent disks) arrays, network-attached storage (NAS), and cluster file systems keep data close, making it quick and easy to access. But in a distributed system, keeping the entire data store close to compute makes scaling slow, cumbersome, and expens...

🏷️ cloud

Any Linux distribution claiming that it wants to make Linux easy and accessible to the general public, as well as to establish itself as a new industry standard for home computing, is bold. But I like it. When a Linux distribution can make such a bold claim, it means they are trying to do something honorable and important: making Linux possible for everyone. The problem is that a lot of distributions make that claim; while some of them succeed, some also fail. The big question here is, does Liya...
