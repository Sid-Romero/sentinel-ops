&quot;Developers always take easy path. So if you make the easiest way the right way, then you have the right outcome.”— Suneer Pallitharammal Mukkolakal, Lead Platform Engineer, World Bank That’s the philosophy that drove the World Bank's platform engineering transformation as they went from 5-day infrastructure provisioning timelines filled with manual processes and configuration drift, to a 30-minute self-service platform that manages 27,000 cloud resources and supports 1,700 applications acr...

**Source:** The New Stack | **Author:** Steven J. Vaughan-Nichols | **Date:** 2026-02-10 19:30 | **Reading Time:** ~7 min

🏷️ docker, security, deployment, cloud

Vendors chasing &ldquo;zero-CVE&rdquo; container images on top of traditional Linux distributions are running into structural limits in upstream release models. CVEs remain a useful, but imperfect metric, for measuring safety.&nbsp; We all want zero Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVEs) in our container images, and creating such images has become a business in itself. What started as an aggressive &ldquo;shift&#8209;left&rdquo; posture has become a baseline expectation for containerized wo...

🏷️ grafana, security, deployment, monitoring, kubernetes

The Extended Berkeley Packet Filter (eBPF)&nbsp; has continued on an adoption path that extends its integral role in observability, security, and networking functionality from the kernel to wherever applications and environments are deployed. Since its creation, it has served as a par excellence way to distribute code directly from the kernel and through a sandbox throughout the network. It enables the gathering of information and interaction with code and applications on the network, essentiall...

🏷️ github, deployment

When GitHub CEO Thomas Dohmke left the Microsoft-owned company in August of 2025, he said he did so to return to his startup roots. Now, after a few months of development, he is launching Entire, a new open-source developer platform that reimagines what collaboration between developers and agents could look like if built from scratch. Entire is backed by a $60 million seed round, the largest in developer tools history, led by Felicis, with participation from Madrona, Basis Set, and M12, Microsof...

🏷️ pipeline, security, automation, gitlab

AI coding assistants are making developers more productive at writing code. But why aren&rsquo;t most enterprises actually delivering more software? That&rsquo;s the question Bill Staples, who took over as CEO of GitLab just over a year ago, says he keeps hearing from customers. &ldquo;They would say: we&rsquo;ve invested. We&rsquo;re using these coding tools. Our engineers love them, but we&rsquo;re not seeing an acceleration in our innovation velocity,&rdquo; Staples says he hears when he talk...

**Source:** The New Stack | **Author:** Ed Huang | **Date:** 2026-02-10 15:00 | **Reading Time:** ~6 min

🏷️ pipeline, infrastructure, cloud

When enterprises talk about artificial intelligence, the attention usually points to models: larger parameters, faster inference, cheaper tokens. But we at TiDB contend that this framing misses the most consequential change now underway in this sector. In the AI era, data infrastructure &mdash; not AI models &mdash; will define the new competitive advantage. This parallels the development of databases themselves, which are undergoing their own fundamental transformation. That belief is shaping t...
