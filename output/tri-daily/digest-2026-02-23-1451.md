### [Kubernetes as AI’s operating system: 1.35 release signals](https://www.cncf.io/blog/2026/02/23/kubernetes-as-ais-operating-system-1-35-release-signals/)

**Source:** CNCF Blog | **Author:** Angel Ramirez, CEO of Cuemby and CNCF Ambassador | **Date:** 2026-02-23 12:00 | **Reading Time:** ~4 min

🏷️ cloud, infrastructure, pipeline, kubernetes, security

Why v1.35 reads like an AI-infrastructure release Kubernetes has become the place where teams coordinate mixed production workloads: services, batch jobs, data pipelines, and ML training. The Kubernetes v1.35 (“Timbernetes”) release reinforces that trajectory with changes that reduce operational friction in scheduling, resource control, and configuration workflows. What stands out in v1.35 is practical: fewer restarts for resizing, new primitives for coordinated placement, and safer defaults for...

### [Gordon: Docker’s AI Agent Just Got an Update](https://www.docker.com/blog/gordon-dockers-ai-agent-just-got-an-update/)

**Source:** Docker Blog | **Author:** Srini Sekaran | **Date:** 2026-02-23 14:13 | **Reading Time:** ~3 min

🏷️ docker, security

AI agents are moving from demos to daily workflows. They write code, run commands, and complete multi-step tasks without constant hand-holding. But general-purpose agents don&#8217;t know Docker. They don&#8217;t understand your containers, your images, or your specific setup. Gordon does. Just run docker ai in your terminal or try it in Docker Desktop. Available today in Docker Desktop 4.61, still in beta, Gordon is an AI agent purpose-built for Docker. It has shell access, Docker CLI access, y...

### [Run OpenClaw Securely in Docker Sandboxes](https://www.docker.com/blog/run-openclaw-securely-in-docker-sandboxes/)

**Source:** Docker Blog | **Author:** Jennifer Kohl | **Date:** 2026-02-23 14:00 | **Reading Time:** ~5 min

🏷️ docker, security, cloud

Docker Sandboxes is a new primitive in the Docker&#8217;s ecosystem that allows you to run AI agents or any other workloads in isolated micro VMs. It provides strong isolation, convenient developer experience and a strong security boundary with a network proxy configurable to deny agents connecting to arbitrary internet hosts. The network proxy will also conveniently inject the API keys, like your ANTHROPIC_API_KEY, or OPENAI_API_KEY in the network proxy so the agent doesn&#8217;t have access to...

### [Coding agents are only as good as the signals you feed them](https://thenewstack.io/coding-agents-feedback-signals/)

**Source:** The New Stack | **Author:** Arjun Iyer | **Date:** 2026-02-23 12:00 | **Reading Time:** ~7 min

🏷️ infrastructure, pipeline, ci/cd, monitoring, observability

The industry has spent the last few years optimizing AI agents&rsquo; code-generation capabilities. The focus has been on expanding context windows, fine-tuning models on repository-specific data, and developing complex prompting strategies. This has undoubtedly produced more capable coding agents. However, for most teams, that code-generation capability has not translated into significant gains in productivity. Most engineering teams are stuck in a manual workflow. The agent generates the code,...

### [This simple infrastructure gap is holding back AI productivity](https://thenewstack.io/this-simple-infrastructure-gap-is-holding-back-ai-productivity/)

**Source:** The New Stack | **Author:** Charlotte Fleming | **Date:** 2026-02-22 16:00 | **Reading Time:** ~5 min

🏷️ automation, infrastructure, pipeline, security, deployment

Organizations are investing heavily in AI, with some allocating up to 8% of their total revenue in AI tools for internal productivity. Yet, the 2025 AI at Work report found that only 1% of companies consider themselves &ldquo;mature&rdquo; in terms of AI deployment. This is an uncomfortable contradiction. The DORA Impact of Generative AI in Software Development report found that as AI adoption increased, delivery throughput declined by 1.5% and stability declined by 7.2%. Code is being written f...

### [Cloudflare’s Markdown for Agents automatically make websites agent-ready](https://thenewstack.io/cloudflares-markdown-for-agents-automatically-make-websites-more-aifriendly/)

**Source:** The New Stack | **Author:** Steven J. Vaughan-Nichols | **Date:** 2026-02-22 15:00 | **Reading Time:** ~3 min

🏷️ security, cloud

Cloudflare, the well-regarded security and Content Delivery Network company, has launched a new feature called &ldquo;Markdown for Agents&rdquo; that automatically converts web pages from HTML to Markdown whenever AI agents request them &mdash; cutting token usage by as much as 80 percent. Why? Can&rsquo;t large language models (LLMs) read HTML? Of course they can, but from a model&rsquo;s perspective, HTML is expensive noise. A typical webpage includes HTML formatting like divs, as well as scri...
