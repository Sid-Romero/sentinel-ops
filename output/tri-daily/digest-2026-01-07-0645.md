### [Deterministic AI Testing with Session Recording in cagent](https://www.docker.com/blog/deterministic-ai-testing-with-session-recording-in-cagent/)

**Source:** Docker Blog | **Author:** Srini Sekaran | **Date:** 2026-01-06 19:16 | **Reading Time:** ~2 min

🏷️ ci/cd, github, security, docker

AI agents introduce a challenge that traditional software doesn’t have: non-determinism. The same prompt can produce different outputs across runs, making reliable testing difficult. Add API costs and latency to the mix, and developer productivity takes a hit. Session recording in cagent addresses this directly. Record an AI interaction once, replay it indefinitely—with identical results, zero API costs, and millisecond execution times. How session recording works cagent implements the VCR patte...

### [What It Takes To Scale AI Agents in Production](https://thenewstack.io/what-it-takes-to-scale-ai-agents-in-production/)

**Source:** The New Stack | **Author:** Raj Shukla | **Date:** 2026-01-06 20:00 | **Reading Time:** ~8 min

🏷️ ci/cd, microservices, infrastructure, pipeline

With the release of &ldquo;reasoning&rdquo; models capable of multistep, test-time compute, the intelligence required to solve complex problems is accessible via a standard API. For the enterprise technical leader, this looks like progress. But it introduces a massive, hidden scalability ceiling. The trap is relying on the large language model (LLM) to act as its own middleware. Teams often expose existing API endpoints, which were built for a strict contract for microservices and not for LLMs a...

### [Serverless Cloud Architecture Is Failing Modern AI Agents](https://thenewstack.io/serverless-cloud-architecture-is-failing-modern-ai-agents/)

**Source:** The New Stack | **Author:** Abigail Wall | **Date:** 2026-01-06 18:00 | **Reading Time:** ~5 min

🏷️ aws, microservices, monitoring, security, infrastructure

For nearly a decade, cloud architecture has been shaped by a simple rule: Keep everything stateless. AWS Lambda and other serverless platforms encouraged teams to carve workloads into tiny, short-lived functions with no persistent state and minimal local resources. This model scaled well, was cost-efficient and became the backbone of modern microservices. By 2025, AI agents were pushed directly into production across sectors such as finance, healthcare, energy, e-commerce and software developmen...

### [The Hidden Engineering Cost of ‘AI Everywhere’ Product Roadmaps](https://thenewstack.io/the-hidden-engineering-cost-of-ai-everywhere-product-roadmaps/)

**Source:** The New Stack | **Author:** Alexander T. Williams | **Date:** 2026-01-06 17:00 | **Reading Time:** ~6 min

🏷️ monitoring, infrastructure, observability, reliability, pipeline

AI has quietly shifted from a differentiator to a default expectation. Product roadmaps now arrive with &ldquo;AI-powered&rdquo; stamped on nearly every feature, whether it makes sense or not. Teams rarely ask if AI is the right tool; they ask how fast it can be added. That mindset feels strategic on the surface, but it carries a hidden engineering tax that compounds over time. Sadly, it&rsquo;s the dev teams that absorb this cost first. Infrastructure expands, complexity multiplies, and reliabi...

**Source:** The New Stack | **Author:** Joab Jackson | **Date:** 2026-01-06 16:00 | **Reading Time:** ~6 min

🏷️ aws, azure, security, infrastructure, kubernetes

Did Kubernetes break up Amazon Web Services cloud party? As the co-founder and CTO of cloud native hardware company Oxide Computer Company, Bryan Cantrill isn&rsquo;t one to shy away from speaking his mind. In a recent wide-ranging interview on the &nbsp;Pragmatic Engineer&nbsp;podcast, hosted by&nbsp;Gergely Orosz,&nbsp; he offered a perspective on how the release of Kubernetes was essential for fueling the growth of the Google Cloud Platform and other nascent cloud providers, when AWS was rele...

### [Data in 2026: Interchangeable Models, Clouds, and Specialization](https://thenewstack.io/data-in-2026-interchangeable-models-clouds-and-specialization/)

**Source:** The New Stack | **Author:** Jelani Harper | **Date:** 2026-01-06 14:00 | **Reading Time:** ~6 min

🏷️ cloud, infrastructure, monitoring, deployment

Current attempts to centralize the increasingly fragmented data ecosystem &mdash; which is distributed across vendors, infrastructure, architectures, and tooling &mdash; are as vast as they are varied. However, they share one point of commonality in 2026: they reinforce the need for a cooperative approach for building applications, deploying them, and reaping their underlying business value. For intelligent agents, this collective approach means greater specialization and quantities of agents in...

🏷️ security, monitoring

Nothing about 2026 feels stable anymore, especially in security. Attacks move faster than your monitoring stack, AI tools leak data behind your back and everyday convenience apps quietly turn into intrusion points. The biggest threats aren’t the ones trending in conference talks but the subtle, boring habits that have crept into your workflow without anyone noticing. Once you start paying [&#8230;]
