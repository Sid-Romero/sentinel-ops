A real-world example of migrating a HIPAA-compliant EHR platform to DHI with minimal code changes. Healthcare software runs on trust. When patient data is at stake, security isn&#8217;t just a feature but a fundamental requirement. For healthcare platform providers, proving that trust to enterprise customers is an ongoing challenge that requires c...

### [Anthropic: You can still use your Claude accounts to run OpenClaw, NanoClaw and Co.](https://thenewstack.io/anthropic-agent-sdk-confusion/)

**Source:** The New Stack | **Author:** Frederic Lardinois | **Date:** 2026-02-18 23:53 | **Reading Time:** ~3 min

OpenClaw, NanoClaw, and the various other personal AI agents that are all the hype right now can quickly burn through millions of AI tokens. What has made them affordable is that even the most basic plans at a flat rate of $20/month from Anthropic or OpenAI allow you to use their coding agents with relatively generous token limits, all without using a pay-as-you-go API key. However, Anthropic recently updated its Claude Code documentation to note that using the OAuth token from those accounts in...

### [Beyond vibe coding: the case for spec-driven AI development](https://thenewstack.io/vibe-coding-spec-driven/)

**Source:** The New Stack | **Author:** Darryl K. Taft | **Date:** 2026-02-18 20:36 | **Reading Time:** ~4 min

🏷️ devops, aws, reliability, cloud

AI is drowning codebases in machine-written output, but without a strategic framework, we aren&rsquo;t just innovating; we&rsquo;re automating the creation of legacy mess, one enterprise software leader argues. With vibe coding, a developer&nbsp;only needs to type a few prompts into an&nbsp;AI coding assistant to&nbsp;create a functioning app in seconds. But if you repeat that process thousands of times across an engineering organization, all that AI-generated code could mean that today&rsquo;s ...

### [Is your on-call rotation quietly burning out top talent?](https://thenewstack.io/sustainable-on-call-strategies/)

**Source:** The New Stack | **Author:** Cristina Dias | **Date:** 2026-02-18 16:54 | **Reading Time:** ~5 min

🏷️ automation, reliability, infrastructure

On-call work is a fact of life for IT operations (ITOps) teams, but as systems complexity and business pressure mount, burnout can quickly spread across teams. When absences increase colleagues&rsquo; workload, reduce capacity, and cause cognitive impairment, they inevitably slow incident management workflows. The good news is that it doesn&rsquo;t need to be this way. &ldquo;By carefully balancing resilience, reliability, and clarity with employee well-being, it&rsquo;s possible to create on-ca...
