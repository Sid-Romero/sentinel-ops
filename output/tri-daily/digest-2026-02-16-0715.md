🏷️ security, infrastructure, pipeline

While AI tools are increasingly used in development, they should enhance rather than replace human input. Developers must shift from merely writing code to orchestrating and validating AI-generated code. This 'spec coding' emphasizes creating specifications that guide both AI and human efforts. Infrastructure must support this transition, with safeguards like reliable build pipelines and automated security scans.
