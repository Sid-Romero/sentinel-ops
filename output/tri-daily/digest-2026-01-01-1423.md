🏷️ infrastructure, reliability, cloud, sre, security

As fast as the old year passes, it&rsquo;s been heartening to see people preserving the work of those who came before us. The Computer History Museum, Stack Overflow and countless nonprofits and foundations have carried yesterday&rsquo;s operating systems, technical discussions and other creative works forward into a fresh new year. As our technology continues to evolve through time &mdash; some becoming obsolete, and others still being resurrected unexpectedly &mdash; we see signs that the tech...

🏷️ grafana, infrastructure, cloud, monitoring, observability

Observability is not living up to expectations. As prices continue to rise, the pain is increasingly felt. This year has a foreboding sense of increased infrastructure complexity to manage at scale. In reaction to skyrocketing public cloud pricing, many organizations have shifted toward private cloud, often resulting in even more complexity. At scale, organizations now increasingly face multi-cloud and heterogeneous environments spanning public cloud, private cloud and on-premises systems. In ma...

If you&rsquo;ve ever used Linux, you might have heard of Vim. Don&rsquo;t run away just yet. Yes, Vim is not exactly the easiest text editor in the world, but it is one of the most powerful available. Vim isn&rsquo;t just a text editor; it&rsquo;s a highly configurable and powerful text editor that&rsquo;s popular among programmers because it&rsquo;s a very efficient tool for coding in the command line. Vim allows users to issue complex commands via keyboard shortcuts, so your fingers never have...

🏷️ github, deployment, infrastructure, security, observability

In cybersecurity, going solo rarely works. Historically, frameworks like CVEs, ATT&amp;CK and software bills of materials (SBOMs) have shown that shared languages of risk turn scattered efforts into coordinated victories. Now, with AI running faster than ever and growing its own &ldquo;muscles and tools,&rdquo; a similar shift is overdue. AI agents can fetch data, take actions and make decisions in milliseconds. Model Context Protocol (MCP) standardizes the way they connect to tools and APIs, wh...

🏷️ cloud, monitoring, devops, automation, gitlab

The year 2025 started out with a bang, with the AI community collectively deciding to use the MCP format to build agentic systems, and moving on to a focus on building operational AI frameworks. For IT operations, however, getting useful work out of AI agents still required considerable planning. Pushing code changes into production, for the time being, still requires human oversight. In a TNS survey,&nbsp;Kevin Reeuwijk, a distinguished architect for&nbsp;Spectro Cloud pointed out that &ldquo;W...

🏷️ monitoring, kubernetes, automation, security, observability

Debugging Kubernetes control plane components can be challenging, especially when you need to quickly understand the runtime state of a component or verify its configuration. With Kubernetes 1.35, we're enhancing the z-pages debugging endpoints with structured, machine-parseable responses that make it easier to build tooling and automate troubleshooting workflows. What are z-pages? z-pages are special debugging endpoints exposed by Kubernetes control plane components. Introduced as an alpha feat...
