🏷️ pipeline, infrastructure, security

While AI tools are increasingly used in development, they should enhance rather than replace human input. Developers must shift from merely writing code to orchestrating and validating AI-generated code. This 'spec coding' emphasizes creating specifications that guide both AI and human efforts. Infrastructure must support this transition, with safeguards like reliable build pipelines and automated security scans. Ultimately, AI is a tool to aid developers, but the nuanced responsibilities of des...

🏷️ cloud, security, deployment, aws

In a blog earlier this February, Snyk engineers said they scanned the entire ClawHub (the OpenClaw marketplace) and found that over 7 percent of the skills contained flaws that expose sensitive credentials. &ldquo;They are functional, popular agent skills that instruct AI agents to mishandle secrets, forcing them to pass API keys, passwords, and even credit card numbers through the LLM&rsquo;s context window and output logs in plaintext,&rdquo; they reported.
