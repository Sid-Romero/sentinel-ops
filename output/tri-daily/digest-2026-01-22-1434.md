### [Platform engineering maintenance pitfalls and smart strategies to stay ahead](https://www.cncf.io/blog/2026/01/21/platform-engineering-maintenance-pitfalls-and-smart-strategies-to-stay-ahead/)

**Source:** CNCF Blog | **Author:** Jehoszafat Zimnowoda, Senior Software Engineer, Akamai and Matthias Erll, Senior Software Engineer, Akamai | **Date:** 2026-01-21 15:00 | **Reading Time:** ~6 min

🏷️ grafana, helm, deployment, github, security

Platform engineering is a discipline that aims to increase the productivity of software engineering teams by designing, building, and maintaining internal platforms that abstract underlying infrastructure complexity and provide self-service capabilities. Kubernetes-based platforms are often complex multi-Open Source Software (OSS) integrations; thus, platform engineering is not a “declare once and forget it” process. It requires continuous dependency maintenance and strategies for inevitable bre...

### [Your Dependencies Don’t Care About Your FIPS Configuration](https://www.docker.com/blog/fips-dependencies-and-prebuilt-binaries/)

**Source:** Docker Blog | **Author:** Jin Kim | **Date:** 2026-01-22 14:00 | **Reading Time:** ~6 min

🏷️ security

FIPS compliance is a great idea that makes the entire software supply chain safer. But teams adopting FIPS-enabled container images are running into strange errors that can be challenging to debug. What they are learning is that correctness at the base image layer does not guarantee compatibility across the ecosystem. Change is complicated, and changing complicated systems with intricate dependency webs often yields surprises. We are in the early adaptation phase of FIPS, and that actually provi...

### [How Precog adds business context to make enterprise data AI-ready](https://thenewstack.io/how-precog-adds-business-context-to-make-enterprise-data-ai-ready/)

**Source:** The New Stack | **Author:** Frederic Lardinois | **Date:** 2026-01-22 14:00 | **Reading Time:** ~4 min

Extracting data from enterprise tools like Salesforce, SAP Ariba, or NetSuite is relatively easy. Making that data usable for AI models to reason over is much harder. Just having massive amounts of tables and columns or giant multidimensional JSON files isn&rsquo;t going to help those models reason over that data. What&rsquo;s missing here is the business context in which the data was generated. Precog, which focuses on helping businesses extract data from Software as a Service (SaaS) API source...

### [Drowning in AI slop, cURL ends bug bounties](https://thenewstack.io/drowning-in-ai-slop-reports-curl-ends-bug-bounties/)

**Source:** The New Stack | **Author:** Steven J. Vaughan-Nichols | **Date:** 2026-01-22 13:00 | **Reading Time:** ~3 min

🏷️ aws, security

Enough is enough. Daniel Steinberg, lead developer and founder of cURL, the popular, open source internet file transfer protocol, is closing down cURL&rsquo;s bug bounty program at the end of January. Why? Because cURL&rsquo;s maintainers are being buried in AI slop. In an interview conducted over Mastodon, Steinberg told me, &ldquo;It is our attempt to remove the incentives for submitting made-up lies. The submission quality has plummeted; not only are lots of the submissions plain slop, but th...

**Source:** The New Stack | **Author:** Adam LaGreca | **Date:** 2026-01-21 23:00 | **Reading Time:** ~3 min

🏷️ reliability, observability, sre, security

It&rsquo;s no surprise following the explosion of AI-driven code generation tools, that we are now seeing a strong AI-driven response from operations and security. Almost by definition, a core function of SREs and security professionals alike is keeping up with the pace of change; of being quick to respond in order to maintain the reliability and safety of online systems. This brings us to the topic at hand: the rise of the AI SRE. There are now three dozen software vendors who either offer an A...

### [Enabling autonomous agents with environment virtualization](https://thenewstack.io/enabling-autonomous-agents-with-environment-virtualization/)

**Source:** The New Stack | **Author:** Arjun Iyer | **Date:** 2026-01-21 22:00 | **Reading Time:** ~6 min

🏷️ ci/cd, deployment, github, pipeline, microservices

I have spent the last year watching the AI conversation shift from smart autocomplete to autonomous contribution. When I test tools like Claude Code or GitHub Copilot Workspace, I am no longer just seeing code suggestions. I am watching them solve tickets and refactor entire modules. The promise is seductive. I imagine assigning a complex task and returning to merged work. But while these agents generate code in seconds, I have discovered that code verification is the new bottleneck. For agents ...

### [Why d-Matrix bets on in-memory compute to break the AI inference bottleneck](https://thenewstack.io/why-d-matrix-bets-on-in-memory-compute-to-break-the-ai-inference-bottleneck/)

**Source:** The New Stack | **Author:** Frederic Lardinois | **Date:** 2026-01-21 20:00 | **Reading Time:** ~7 min

🏷️ deployment, aws, cloud

AI inference is poised to become the single largest compute workload. For some time now, after all, AI service providers like OpenAI have claimed that they are mostly constrained by compute availability. Even as these companies build massive, power-hungry data centers to run both their training and inference workloads, the need for optimized hardware and software solutions remains. Meanwhile, it&rsquo;s not just the frontier AI labs that are concerned with the cost of running these models, but i...

### [Should enterprises run containers in VMs or bare metal?](https://thenewstack.io/should-enterprises-run-containers-in-vms-or-bare-metal/)

**Source:** The New Stack | **Author:** Jelani Harper | **Date:** 2026-01-21 19:00 | **Reading Time:** ~5 min

🏷️ deployment, security, infrastructure, azure, aws

The wonders of containers &mdash; their overall flexibility, portability, and logical encapsulation of everything needed to run an application &mdash; have made them a mainstream method of developing and deploying modern apps. The latter is enhanced through orchestration platforms like Kubernetes, particularly for deployments at scale. Nonetheless, there are still questions about how to maximize containers&rsquo; utility. Should you run them on bare metal servers or on virtual machines (VMs)? Is...

🏷️ ci/cd, deployment, security, pipeline, automation

Note: This was originally published on Jan. 12, 2026, and has been updated with information from the live event. When Argo CD v1.0 was released in 2019, it unleashed the concept of GitOps. By enabling cloud native teams to manage infrastructure as code, GitOps uses automation to make complex deployments faster while also making it easier to detect drift and reconcile workflows. While Argo CD is the most widely used, Argo is actually a family of four Kubernetes-native, open source projects, expla...

### [Building scalable agentic assistants: A graph-based approach](https://thenewstack.io/building-scalable-agentic-assistants-a-graph-based-approach/)

**Source:** The New Stack | **Author:** Abhishek Sant | **Date:** 2026-01-21 18:00 | **Reading Time:** ~4 min

About a year back, we got pulled into what looked like a straightforward problem: Build an interface assistant that could answer questions about payments, disputes, transactions, and insights. The reality turned out to be far more complex. Many teams already had several data sources, internal tools and domain experts working together. What we didn&rsquo;t have was a way to wire all this together into something that felt coherent, reliable, and scalable. Early experiments with single-agent chatbo...

### [Hardened containers don’t fix a broken software supply chain](https://thenewstack.io/hardened-containers-dont-fix-a-broken-software-supply-chain/)

**Source:** The New Stack | **Author:** Dan Lorenc | **Date:** 2026-01-21 17:00 | **Reading Time:** ~4 min

🏷️ automation, security, pipeline, docker

The software supply chain is broken, and the recent explosion of hardened container offerings is the industry&rsquo;s reaction. A few years ago, secure container images were a niche concern. Today, they&rsquo;re everywhere. The industry has responded by tightening inspection at the end of the assembly line (more checks, more scanners) while largely ignoring how the parts get sourced, assembled, and verified upstream. The company I co-founded started working on software supply chain security four...

### [Focus on ‘Don’ts’ to build systems that know when to say ‘No’](https://thenewstack.io/focus-on-donts-to-build-systems-that-know-when-to-say-no/)

**Source:** The New Stack | **Author:** AJ Sunder | **Date:** 2026-01-21 16:00 | **Reading Time:** ~4 min

🏷️ reliability

If your AI knowledge base only lists policies, your organization is operating with half its institutional intelligence. An internal knowledge base is vital for AI agents, serving as the organizational memory that grounds responses in verified company data and reduces the risk of hallucinating company-specific information.Without it, agents fill knowledge gaps by generating plausible-sounding but potentially incorrect responses based on their training data. A knowledge base&rsquo;s content should...
