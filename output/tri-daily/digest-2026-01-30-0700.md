**Source:** DevOps.com | **Author:** Jeff Burt | **Date:** 2026-01-30 01:04 | **Reading Time:** ~1 min

In the wake of the massive Shai-Hulud supply chain attack that ripped through npm late last year and compromised more than 700 packages and exposed 25,000 repositories, developers in the JavaScript world embraced a two-part defense strategy. The widely adopted playbook called for disabling lifecycle scripts and using lockfiles. “It became the standard advice everywhere [&#8230;]

### [Gemini CLI gets its hooks into the agentic development loop](https://thenewstack.io/gemini-cli-gets-its-hooks-into-the-agentic-development-loop/)

**Source:** The New Stack | **Author:** Frederic Lardinois | **Date:** 2026-01-29 19:42 | **Reading Time:** ~3 min

🏷️ security, github

Google has added hooks to Gemini CLI, its terminal-based competitor to Anthropic&rsquo;s Claude Code. Hooks ensure that Gemini CLI runs a given script or program inside of the agentic loop and bring a larger degree of control to the agentic development loop. These could be used, for example, to run security scanners or compliance checks, log tool interactions, inject relevant information into the context window, or even adjust the model&rsquo;s parameters on the fly. As the Gemini CLI team notes...

🏷️ infrastructure, cloud

In the new world of agentic AI, the discussion has revolved around data: governance, storage, and compute. But what about metadata &mdash; the data about data? Metadata has been a second-class citizen, according to Junping (JP) Du, founder and CEO of Datastrato, a data and AI infrastructure company. AI is changing how data &mdash; and metadata &mdash; is consumed, understood, and governed, so Datastrato created Apache Gravitino, an open source project that serves as a high-performance, geo-distr...

🏷️ infrastructure, pipeline, cloud, kubernetes

The recent release of the background coding agent Inspect by Ramp&rsquo;s engineering team serves as a definitive proof point that closed-loop agentic systems are the future of software development. It has transformed coding agents into truly autonomous engineering partners, and it is fundamentally changing the way agents deliver software. Whether teams use a custom cloud development environment (CDE) like Ramp or another approach, the signal is clear: Teams need to solve for this kind of autono...

### [Prompting vs. RAG vs. fine-tuning: Why it’s not a ladder](https://thenewstack.io/prompting-vs-rag-vs-fine-tuning-why-its-not-a-ladder/)

**Source:** The New Stack | **Author:** Ibrahim Kamal | **Date:** 2026-01-29 18:00 | **Reading Time:** ~12 min

🏷️ reliability, infrastructure, pipeline, security, deployment

Teams usually assume there&rsquo;s a straightforward progression from prompt engineering through retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) to fine-tuning (the last rung on the ladder) when customizing large language models (LLMs). This is an easy-to-understand, frequently repeated narrative that is true for some developers but not for all teams working with LLMs in production environments. Prompt engineering, RAG, and fine-tuning are not sequential upgrades in real-world enterprise systems. Instead, ...

🏷️ devops, security

An analysis published today by Opsera, a provider of a DevOps platform, finds that while adoption of artificial intelligence (AI) coding tools has increased developer productivity they also create more duplicate code, resulting in 15 to 18% more security vulnerabilities per line of code compared to code created by a human developer. Overall, the Opsera [&#8230;]
