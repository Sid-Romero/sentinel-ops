### [Platform engineering maintenance pitfalls and smart strategies to stay ahead](https://www.cncf.io/blog/2026/01/21/platform-engineering-maintenance-pitfalls-and-smart-strategies-to-stay-ahead/)

**Source:** CNCF Blog | **Author:** Jehoszafat Zimnowoda, Senior Software Engineer, Akamai and Matthias Erll, Senior Software Engineer, Akamai | **Date:** 2026-01-21 15:00 | **Reading Time:** ~6 min

🏷️ kubernetes, helm, cloud, deployment, automation

Platform engineering is a discipline that aims to increase the productivity of software engineering teams by designing, building, and maintaining internal platforms that abstract underlying infrastructure complexity and provide self-service capabilities. Kubernetes-based platforms are often complex multi-Open Source Software (OSS) integrations; thus, platform engineering is not a “declare once and forget it” process. It requires continuous dependency maintenance and strategies for inevitable bre...

### [Enabling autonomous agents with environment virtualization](https://thenewstack.io/enabling-autonomous-agents-with-environment-virtualization/)

**Source:** The New Stack | **Author:** Arjun Iyer | **Date:** 2026-01-21 22:00 | **Reading Time:** ~6 min

🏷️ kubernetes, pipeline, ci/cd, cloud, deployment

I have spent the last year watching the AI conversation shift from smart autocomplete to autonomous contribution. When I test tools like Claude Code or GitHub Copilot Workspace, I am no longer just seeing code suggestions. I am watching them solve tickets and refactor entire modules. The promise is seductive. I imagine assigning a complex task and returning to merged work. But while these agents generate code in seconds, I have discovered that code verification is the new bottleneck. For agents ...

### [Why d-Matrix bets on in-memory compute to break the AI inference bottleneck](https://thenewstack.io/why-d-matrix-bets-on-in-memory-compute-to-break-the-ai-inference-bottleneck/)

**Source:** The New Stack | **Author:** Frederic Lardinois | **Date:** 2026-01-21 20:00 | **Reading Time:** ~7 min

🏷️ cloud, deployment, aws

AI inference is poised to become the single largest compute workload. For some time now, after all, AI service providers like OpenAI have claimed that they are mostly constrained by compute availability. Even as these companies build massive, power-hungry data centers to run both their training and inference workloads, the need for optimized hardware and software solutions remains. Meanwhile, it&rsquo;s not just the frontier AI labs that are concerned with the cost of running these models, but i...

### [Should enterprises run containers in VMs or bare metal?](https://thenewstack.io/should-enterprises-run-containers-in-vms-or-bare-metal/)

**Source:** The New Stack | **Author:** Jelani Harper | **Date:** 2026-01-21 19:00 | **Reading Time:** ~5 min

🏷️ kubernetes, aws, cloud, deployment, infrastructure

The wonders of containers &mdash; their overall flexibility, portability, and logical encapsulation of everything needed to run an application &mdash; have made them a mainstream method of developing and deploying modern apps. The latter is enhanced through orchestration platforms like Kubernetes, particularly for deployments at scale. Nonetheless, there are still questions about how to maximize containers&rsquo; utility. Should you run them on bare metal servers or on virtual machines (VMs)? Is...

### [How to scale GitOps without maxing out](https://thenewstack.io/how-to-scale-gitops-without-hitting-the-argo-ceiling/)

**Source:** The New Stack | **Author:** Vicki Walker | **Date:** 2026-01-21 18:30 | **Reading Time:** ~3 min

🏷️ kubernetes, gitops, pipeline, devops, ci/cd

Note: This was originally published on Jan. 12, 2026, and has been updated with information from the live event. When Argo CD v1.0 was released in 2019, it unleashed the concept of GitOps. By enabling cloud native teams to manage infrastructure as code, GitOps uses automation to make complex deployments faster while also making it easier to detect drift and reconcile workflows. While Argo CD is the most widely used, Argo is actually a family of four Kubernetes-native, open source projects, expla...

### [Building scalable agentic assistants: A graph-based approach](https://thenewstack.io/building-scalable-agentic-assistants-a-graph-based-approach/)

**Source:** The New Stack | **Author:** Abhishek Sant | **Date:** 2026-01-21 18:00 | **Reading Time:** ~4 min

About a year back, we got pulled into what looked like a straightforward problem: Build an interface assistant that could answer questions about payments, disputes, transactions, and insights. The reality turned out to be far more complex. Many teams already had several data sources, internal tools and domain experts working together. What we didn&rsquo;t have was a way to wire all this together into something that felt coherent, reliable, and scalable. Early experiments with single-agent chatbo...

### [Hardened containers don’t fix a broken software supply chain](https://thenewstack.io/hardened-containers-dont-fix-a-broken-software-supply-chain/)

**Source:** The New Stack | **Author:** Dan Lorenc | **Date:** 2026-01-21 17:00 | **Reading Time:** ~4 min

🏷️ automation, pipeline, docker, security

The software supply chain is broken, and the recent explosion of hardened container offerings is the industry&rsquo;s reaction. A few years ago, secure container images were a niche concern. Today, they&rsquo;re everywhere. The industry has responded by tightening inspection at the end of the assembly line (more checks, more scanners) while largely ignoring how the parts get sourced, assembled, and verified upstream. The company I co-founded started working on software supply chain security four...

### [Focus on ‘Don’ts’ to build systems that know when to say ‘No’](https://thenewstack.io/focus-on-donts-to-build-systems-that-know-when-to-say-no/)

**Source:** The New Stack | **Author:** AJ Sunder | **Date:** 2026-01-21 16:00 | **Reading Time:** ~4 min

🏷️ reliability

If your AI knowledge base only lists policies, your organization is operating with half its institutional intelligence. An internal knowledge base is vital for AI agents, serving as the organizational memory that grounds responses in verified company data and reduces the risk of hallucinating company-specific information.Without it, agents fill knowledge gaps by generating plausible-sounding but potentially incorrect responses based on their training data. A knowledge base&rsquo;s content should...

### [How Rust does Async differently (and why it matters)](https://thenewstack.io/how-rust-does-async-differently-and-why-it-matters/)

**Source:** The New Stack | **Author:** Anshul Gupta | **Date:** 2026-01-21 14:00 | **Reading Time:** ~6 min

This is the first of a four-part series. If you are coming from JavaScript, Python or Go, Rust&rsquo;s asynchronous model can feel like a bit of a culture shock. In those languages, the runtime is a &ldquo;black box&rdquo; that just works. In Rust, the hood is wide open, and the engine looks very different. Why learn this? Most developers &ldquo;use&rdquo; async. Very few understand it. By peeling back the layers of Rust&rsquo;s implementation, you aren&rsquo;t just learning a language; you&rsqu...

### [Vibe coding could cause catastrophic ‘explosions’ in 2026](https://thenewstack.io/vibe-coding-could-cause-catastrophic-explosions-in-2026/)

**Source:** The New Stack | **Author:** Darryl K. Taft | **Date:** 2026-01-20 23:00 | **Reading Time:** ~5 min

🏷️ security

The steady buildout of vibe-coded applications into production will lead to catastrophic problems for organizations that don&rsquo;t properly review AI-developed software, a software security expert predicts. David Mytton, founder and CEO of developer security provider Arcjet, writes in a LinkedIn post: &ldquo;In 2026, I expect more and more vibe-coded applications hitting production in a big way. That&rsquo;s going to be great for velocity &hellip; but you&rsquo;ve still got to pay attention. T...
