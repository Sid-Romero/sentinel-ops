We use GenAI in every facet of technology now &#8211; internal knowledge bases, customer support systems, and code review bots, to name just a few use cases. And in nearly every one of these, someone eventually asks: What stops the model from returning something the user shouldn’t see?” This is a roadblock that companies building RAG features or AI Agents eventually hit &#8211; the moment where an LLM returns data from a document that the user was not authorized to access, introducing potential ...

🏷️ reliability, docker, ci/cd, pipeline, infrastructure

Why a “protected repo”? Modern teams depend on public container images, yet most environments lack a single, auditable control point for what gets pulled and when. This often leads to three operational challenges: Inconsistent or improvised base images that drift across teams and pipelines. Exposure to new CVEs when tags remain unchanged but upstream content does not. Unreliable workflows due to rate limiting, throttling, or pull interruptions. A protected repository addresses these challenges b...

🏷️ infrastructure, cloud, security

New threats emerge every week, and many vendors respond with narrow, new reactive cybersecurity tool purchases to make sure a specific incident never happens again. The result? Tool sprawl. Some organizations now rely on anywhere from 45 to 83 separate cybersecurity tools. This fragmented approach drives up costs, complicates workflows, and (believe it or not) actually increases risk and makes you less secure due to poor integration and limited visibility. Business leaders are taking notice: Wha...

The mandate to leverage data and AI for operational gain is forcing businesses to reckon with growing complexity in their IT infrastructure. As a result, leaders are now asking: What is hybrid cloud, and what role will it play in our company’s future? Increasingly, companies rely on a mix of public and private cloud infrastructure services, as well as systems they own and operate themselves. Done right, this hybrid architecture lets organizations connect on-premises solutions that still support ...

I&rsquo;ve been using Linux since 1997. As the &rsquo;90s came to a close, there were so many new distributions coming out that it would make your head spin.

For years, site reliability engineering (SRE) has centered on one mission: keeping systems healthy while everything else &mdash; code, configurations and infrastructure &mdash; changes around them. But as complexity grows, even the most experienced SREs hit a wall. Logs multiply, dependencies intertwine and issues proliferate. The future of reliability engineering is no longer about reacting faster; it&rsquo;s about preventing failures before they occur. SRE has evolved through three distinct st...

While code and data interplay with each other to form running programs, we still tend to concern ourselves more with how code is presented than how data is presented. While masses of streaming data can often move unseen and is truly meaningless, JavaScript Object Notation (aka JSON) was specifically designed as a standard text-based format for representing small amounts of human-readable structured data. The first time you might come across the need for this type of representation is when you wa...

Recently, I procured a Zettlab AI NAS. This was mostly to be used to house a metric ton of video files that I work with, as my external drives were constantly getting full of clips that I no longer needed to work on, but didn&rsquo;t want to get rid of (you know&hellip; just in case). After deploying the NAS, I started poking around and noticed it had an app store. Curiosity got the best of me, so I decided to give the app store a look.

🏷️ reliability, infrastructure, pipeline, deployment

Enterprise AI inherited the consumer model of AI, but it&rsquo;s the wrong one for most business-to-business (B2B) problems. In the consumer world, the appeal of generative AI is its role as an omniscient polymath. A single interface can write a poem, debug code, plan a vacation and answer trivia pulled from across the public internet. This makes sense in an open world, where the range of possible questions is unbounded and success is subjective. When AI must handle anything a user might ask, sc...

In today&rsquo;s enterprise landscape, AI may dominate the conversation, but legacy systems still underpin mission-critical operations for many &mdash; if not most &mdash; businesses.
