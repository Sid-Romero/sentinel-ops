The promise of DevOps and Platform Engineering is to balance developer velocity with enterprise governance. In 2026, AI Agents move from being simple assistance tools to the core mechanisms that automate this balance. Recent publications, such as the CNCF 2025 Technology Radar report, highlight growing experimentation with agentic AI standards (for example, MCP). As we begin 2026, it’s time to forecast how the enterprise shift to autonomy will be defined by four distinct, AI-driven control mecha...

Platform engineering is a discipline that aims to increase the productivity of software engineering teams by designing, building, and maintaining internal platforms that abstract underlying infrastructure complexity and provide self-service capabilities. Kubernetes-based platforms are often complex multi-Open Source Software (OSS) integrations; thus, platform engineering is not a “declare once and forget it” process. It requires continuous dependency maintenance and strategies for inevitable bre...

The problem nobody talks about GPUs are expensive; and yours are probably sitting idle right now. High-end GPUs (for example, NVIDIA A100-class devices) can cost $10,000+, and in a Kubernetes cluster running AI workloads, you might have dozens of them. Here&#8217;s the uncomfortable truth: most of the time, they&#8217;re sitting idle. If you&#8217;re struggling with GPU scheduling in Kubernetes or looking for ways to reclaim idle GPUs, you&#8217;re not alone. A data scientist spins up a training...

Customizing Docker Hardened Images In Part 1 and Part 2, we established the baseline. You migrated a service to a Docker Hardened Image (DHI), witnessed the vulnerability count drop to zero, and verified the cryptographic signatures and SLSA provenance that make DHI a compliant foundation. But no matter how secure a base image is, it is useless if you can&#8217;t run your application on it. This brings us to the most common question engineers ask during a DHI trial: what if I need a custom image...

Verifying Security and Compliance of Docker Hardened Images In Part 1 of this series, we migrated a Node.js service to Docker Hardened Images (DHI) and measured impressive results: 100% vulnerability elimination, 90% package reduction, and 41.5% size decrease. We extracted the SBOM and saw compliance labels for FIPS, STIG, and CIS. The numbers look compelling. But how do you verify these claims independently?

Model Context Protocol (MCP) servers are a spec for exposing tools, models, or services to language models through a common interface. Think of them as smart adapters: they sit between a tool and the LLM, speaking a predictable protocol that lets the model interact with things like APIs, databases, and agents without needing to know implementation details. But like most good ideas, the devil’s in the details. The Promise—and the Problems of Running MCP Servers Running an MCP sounds simple: spin ...

FIPS compliance is a great idea that makes the entire software supply chain safer. But teams adopting FIPS-enabled container images are running into strange errors that can be challenging to debug. What they are learning is that correctness at the base image layer does not guarantee compatibility across the ecosystem. Change is complicated, and changing complicated systems with intricate dependency webs often yields surprises. We are in the early adaptation phase of FIPS, and that actually provi...

The Model Context Protocol (MCP) has quickly become a well-adopted standard for connecting large language model (LLM)-based AI agents with external data and tools. As a result, many developers are stacking their environments with MCP tools. Seventy percent of MCP consumers have two to seven MCP servers configured, according to a late-2025 study by Zuplo. But every MCP added consumes memory, which is thinning as context windows must store chat histories and configuration files, while agents chain...

Teams that have run Software as a Service (SaaS) products know the routine: An alert goes off, and everyone scrambles to the observability stack first. Metrics, logs, and traces have been the signals that help engineers figure out what broke, why users are stuck or where a service-level agreement (SLA) may have slipped.
