Ten years into CNCF’s journey, one thing hasn’t changed: we still rely on real signals—open source contributions, real-world deployments, and community energy—to understand where we’re headed. Cloud native is now invisible infrastructure, quietly powering our everyday lives. By watching the pace of project activity, we get a front-row seat to how teams are building the future. We dig into signals like commit frequency, contributor growth, community expansion, and deployment patterns to map where...

Cluster API brings declarative management to Kubernetes cluster lifecycle, allowing users and platform teams to define the desired state of clusters and rely on controllers to continuously reconcile toward it. Similar to how you can use StatefulSets or Deployments in Kubernetes to manage a group of Pods, in Cluster API you can use KubeadmControlPlane to manage a set of control plane Machines, or you can use MachineDeployments to manage a group of worker Nodes.

Docker Hardened Images are now free, covering Alpine, Debian, and over 1,000 images including databases, runtimes, and message buses. For security teams, this changes the economics of container vulnerability management. DHI includes security fixes from Docker’s security team, which simplifies security response. Platform teams can pull the patched base image and redeploy quickly. But free hardened images raise a question: how should this change your security practice? Here’s how our thinking is e...

Seven years ago, managing security and compliance was fairly straightforward at Duke Energy. Most of the company’s applications ran on-premises. Security teams had complete control over almost everything. But when the 100-year-old, regulated utility moved to the cloud, all of that changed. Enforcing security without hampering delivery speed became much more complicated. In our conversation with Duke Energy, they told us about their requirements around maintaining speed under regulation. In this ...

While AI tools are increasingly used in development, they should enhance rather than replace human input. Developers must shift from merely writing code to orchestrating and validating AI-generated code. This 'spec coding' emphasizes creating specifications that guide both AI and human efforts. Infrastructure must support this transition, with safeguards like reliable build pipelines and automated security scans. Ultimately, AI is a tool to aid developers, but the nuanced responsibilities of des...

A lot of the hype around agents has been around writing code, but what if you could have an agent watch for events in your GitHub repo and automatically run a set workflow when, for example, a new issue is created? And what if you could just describe the workflow to the agent, and then have it generate the detailed steps for you?

The agentic AI race is on, and most organizations are at risk of losing it. Not because they lack ambition, but because they&rsquo;re fighting three wars simultaneously without a unified strategy. Looking at what separates successful agentic AI programs from the 40% that Gartner predicts will be canceled by 2027, the pattern is clear. Organizations aren&rsquo;t failing at AI. They&rsquo;re failing at the infrastructure that makes AI work at enterprise scale. There are three underlying crises of ...
