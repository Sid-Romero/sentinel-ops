Agentic systems are rapidly moving from experimentation into real production workloads. Cloud native teams are now being asked to connect models to real tools, data, and workflows in reliable, secure ways—without relying on brittle, one-off integrations. As MCP emerges as a shared, interoperable layer under vendor-neutral stewardship, Agentics Day provides a focused space for the community to exchange real-world implementations and shape best practices while the ecosystem is still evolving.

When it comes to building dynamic and real-work solutions, developers need to stitch multiple databases (relational, document, graph, vector, time-series, search) together and build complex API layers to integrate them. This generates significant complexity, cost, and operational risk, and reduces speed of innovation. More often than not, developers end up focusing on building glue code and managing infrastructure rather than building application logic. For AI use cases, using multiple databases...

🏷️ infrastructure, deployment, pipeline, security, automation

Organizations are investing heavily in AI, with some allocating up to 8% of their total revenue in AI tools for internal productivity. Yet, the 2025 AI at Work report found that only 1% of companies consider themselves &ldquo;mature&rdquo; in terms of AI deployment. This is an uncomfortable contradiction. The DORA Impact of Generative AI in Software Development report found that as AI adoption increased, delivery throughput declined by 1.5% and stability declined by 7.2%. Code is being written f...

Cloudflare, the well-regarded security and Content Delivery Network company, has launched a new feature called &ldquo;Markdown for Agents&rdquo; that automatically converts web pages from HTML to Markdown whenever AI agents request them &mdash; cutting token usage by as much as 80 percent.

By now it&rsquo;s pretty clear that JavaScript needs WebAssembly (Wasm) to perform heavy computational tasks.

One thing I didn&rsquo;t do last year was go to any Model Context Protocol (MCP) conferences, largely because I couldn&rsquo;t see why one very young protocol could represent the wide world of LLMs. But with the speed of AI development, MCP is now looking for a gym membership and checking its pension plan. Going to the London MCPconference last week (they are worldwide now) allowed me to dip into the issues that developers are seeing in the area of LLM and tool connections &ndash; and perhaps ho...

As someone who had a front-row seat to the container orchestration wars, I am watching the same movie play out again with AI agent frameworks. It&rsquo;s just that the cast is different, and the stakes are much higher, but the plot is almost identical. In 2015, if you wanted to orchestrate containers, you had a plethora of choices.

This solution is temporary and not recommended for the long run because it may result in conflicts between Argo CD K8s field manager and other field managers at a later point in time, and if you use it, you will need to remove it after the above issue is fixed.
